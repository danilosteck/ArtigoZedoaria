Principal sesquiterpenes, furanodiene, germacrone, curdione, neocurdione, curcumenol, isocurcumenol, aerugidiol, zedoarondiol, and curcumenone and curcumin were found to show potent protective effect on D-galactosamine (D-GalN) /lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute liver injury in mice. Plausible action mechanisms for their hepatoprotective activity were clarified on the basis of the inhibitory effect on D-GalN-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured rat hepatocytes, LPS-induced NO production in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages, and D-GalN /tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced liver injury in mice.

J	Kim, DI; Lee, TK; Jang, TH; Kim, CH				Kim, DI; Lee, TK; Jang, TH; Kim, CH			The inhibitory effect of a Korean herbal medicine, Zedoariae rhizoma, on growth of cultured human hepatic myofibroblast cells	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Zedoariae rhizome; cellular proliferation; human hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF); antifibrotic agents; growth inhibition; prostaglandin E2; COX-2; antiproliferative effect; liver fibrogenesis	CHINESE NATURAL MEDICINES; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; STELLATE CELLS; BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS; ABSOLUTE STEREOSTRUCTURES; LIVER MYOFIBROBLASTS; CHEMICAL STRUCTURES; UNDERGROUND PART; MEDIATED PATHWAY; RHODIOLAE RADIX	The aim of this study was to assess the effect of ZR on the growth of cultured human hepatic myofibroblast cells (hMF). The zedoary (Zedoariae Rhizoma) made from the dried rhizome of Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe is an herbal drug used as an aromatic stomachic. The plant is a perennial herb which is natively distributed throughout Korea and is a traditional Korean herbal medicine. Zedoariae rhizoma is a bioactive traditional medicine with antitumor, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-inflammation, and growth-regulating properties. During the course of liver fibrogenesis, hMF, mostly derived from hepatic stellate cells, proliferate and synthesize excessive amounts of extracellular matrix components. To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of a traditional herbal medicine, Zedoariae rhizoma water extracts (ZR) was examined on the growth inhibition of hMF since proliferation of hMF is known to be central for the development of fibrosis during liver injury, and factors that may limit their growth are potential antifibrotic agents. The aim of this study was to test the effects of ZR on the proliferation in cultured hMF. hMF were obtained by outgrowth from human liver explants. ZR markedly reduced serum driven cell proliferation, as assessed by nuclear autoradiography experiments and measurement of actual cell growth. Growth inhibition was totally reversed after removal of the ZR. ZR potently inhibited hMF growth (IC50 = 8.5 mu g/ml), in a pertussis toxininsensitive manner. Analysis of the mechanisms involved in growth inhibition revealed that ZR rapidly increased prostaglandin E2 production and in turn cAMP, which inhibited hMF proliferation, did not affect cAMP levels. Production of cAMP by ZR was abolished by NS-398, a selective inhibitor of cycloxygenase (COX)-2. Also, ZR potently induced COX-2 protein expression. Blocking COX-2 by NS-398 blunted the antiproliferative effect of ZR. We conclude that ZR inhibits proliferation of bMF, probably via an intracellular mechanism, through early COX-2-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and cAMP, and delayed COX-2 induction. Our results indicated a novel role for ZR as a growth inhibitory mediator and pointed out its potential involvement in the negative regulation of liver fibrogenesis. The results that ZR exhibits potent antiproliferative and antifibrogenic effects toward hMF, indicated that ZR might have therapeutic implications in chronic liver disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Petroleum ether, hexane, chloroform, acetone and ethanol extracts exhibited antibacterial as well as antifungal activity. Acetone and hexane extracts of both tubers showed comparable antimicrobial activity as indicated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, but other extracts of Curcuma malabarica showed significantly lower activity than those of Curcuma zedoaria. The MIC values for different strains and extracts ranged from 0.01 to 0. 15 mg/ml in Curcuma zedoaria and from 0.01 to 0.94 mg/ml in Curcuma malabarica. Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive) was inhibited by Curcuma malabarica but not by Curcuma zedoaria. This study is the first report of the antimicrobial properties of Curcuma malabarica. The findings also support the use of Curcuma zedoaria tubers in traditional medicine for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Many different mechanisms should be involved in the benefit effect of Astragalus membranaceus and Curcuma zedoaria. In this study, we established that the combined extract from Astragalus membranaceus and Curcuma zedoaria (HQEZ) decreased the metastasis ability in colorectal cancer cells (HCT116, a cell line of colorectal carcinoma established from Homo sapiens) in vitro, and the treatment induced the downregulation of EMT signal and decreased CXCR4 expression and the level of -catenin. Overexpression of CXCR4 and the administration of the agonist and inhibitor to -catenin signal pathway were used to explore the mechanism of Astragalus membranaceus and Curcuma zedoaria in colorectal cancer treatment. The data demonstrated that HQEZ increased the phosphorylation of -catenin which related to the degradation of -catenin, and it induced the downregulation of EMT signal and CXCR4. It meant that the influence of -catenin should be a key event in the antimetastasis effects of Astragalus membranaceus-Curcuma zedoaria in colorectal cancer model. These findings revealed the potential effect and mechanism of Astragalus membranaceus-Curcuma zedoaria in colorectal cancer treatment and provided insight for optimization of the usage.

This study aimed to identify the cytotoxic components from C. zedoaria rhizomes that act against gastric cancer, which is the third leading cause of death from cancer worldwide because the MeOH extract of C. zedoaria rhizome was found to show a cytotoxic effect against gastric cancer AGS cells. Repeated column chromatography and semi-preparative HPLC purification were used to separate the components from the C. zedoaria MeOH extract. Two new sesquiterpenes, curcumenol-9,10-epoxide (1) and curcuzedoalide B (2), and 12 known related sesquiterpenes (3-14) were isolated from the C. zedoaria MeOH extract. The structures of new compounds were determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic experiments and HR-ESIMS, and quantum chemical ECD calculations. The cytotoxic effects of the isolated compounds were measured in human gastric cancer AGS cells using an MTT cell viability assay. Compounds 9, 10, and 12 exhibited cytotoxic effects against gastric cancer AGS cells, with IC50, values in the range of 212-392 mu M. These findings provide further experimental scientific evidence to support the traditional use of C. zedoaria rhizomes for the treatment of cancer. Curcumenol (9), 4,8-dioxo-6 beta-methoxy-7 alpha,11-epoxycarabrane (10), and zedoarofuran (12) were identified as the main cytotoxic components in C. zedoaria rhizomes.

However, there have not been any reports of these genes in Curcuma zedoaria. Objective: The present work reports on the isolation of genes encoding enzymes in curcuminoid metabolic pathway and their expression in C. zedoaria. Method: The primers were designed from untranslation regions of DCS, CURS1, CURS2 and CURS3 genes which are involved in curcuminoid biosynthesis in C. longa to isolate the corresponding full-length genes in C. zedoaria. RT-PCR amplification and HPLC analysis are used to estimate the expression of genes and biosynthesis of curcumin in both rhizome and callus. Results: The results showed that all four genes from C. zedoaria (named CzDCS, CzCURS1, CzCURS2 and CzCURS3) and C. longa have a high identity (approximately 99%) and lengths of genes from C. zedoaria are 1382, 1240, 1288 and 1265 nu, respectively. CzCURS1, 2 and 3 genes have one intron while CzDCS has two introns. RT-PCR amplification indicated that curcuminoid genes expressed mRNA in rhizome and callus of C. zedoaria. Curcumin, a major component of curcuminoids, was also found in callus by HPLC analysis. Conclusion: The sequence information of DCS and CURS1-3 genes in C. zedoaria will be very valuable for a subsequent study on the effects of elicitors on the transcription of genes involved in curcuminoid biosynthesis pathway.

To evaluate the effect of petroleum ether extracts of Curcuma zedoaria on the proliferation of human triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Methods. The reagents were isolated from Curcuma zedoaria by petroleum ether fraction. It was assayed by CCK8 for MDA-MB-231 cellular viability with various concentrations and days, cell cycle analyses, Western Blot analysis, and Realtime Reverse Transcriptase PCR analyses for chemokines molecules including E-cadherin, and E-selectin, and adhesion molecules including CCR7, SLC, SDF-1, and CXCR4. Epirubicin was used as control in the study. Results. MDA-MB-231 cells were inhibited by petroleum ether extracts of Curcuma zedoaria (P < 0.05), and the inhibition rate was dependent on concentrations and time. Petroleum ether extracts of Curcuma zedoaria as well as Epirubicin produce a significant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The level of expression of proteins E-cadherin and E-cadherin mRNA was significantly increased, while proteins SDF-1, CCR7, and CXCR4 mRNA were decreased after being incubated with petroleum ether extracts of Curcuma zedoaria at the concentrations of 300 mu g/mL than control (P < 0.05). The differences were that the protein CXCR4 mRNA expression level was higher than vehicle. Conclusions. MDA-MB-231 cells were inhibited by petroleum ether extracts of Curcuma zedoaria.

G. Lee et C. F. Liang, or Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C.Ling) is a representative herb with clinical effects on liver diseases after being vinegar-processed. The crude Curcuma zedoaria and the processed Curcuma zedoaria (vinegar-boil) have been widely used as mixtures, but their equivalence has not been fully investigated. In this manuscript, quality markers of processed (vinegar-boil) Curcuma zedoaria were investigated by comparison of the compounds and hepatoprotective activities with the crude (three spices) ones. First, GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics were applied to reveal the discriminatory components and discover potential markers. As a result, a total of six components were identified as potential markers. Then, the hepatoprotective activities were evaluated by dual cell damage models induced by a certain concentration of H2O2 or tertbutyl hydfroperoxide (t-BHP) (55 M H2O2 or 40 M t-BHP), which highlighted the potential of the processed Curcuma zedoaria on oxidative stress. Finally, epicurzerenone was identified as its quality marker on oxidative liver injury based on the above results and the cell-based biological assay. Overall, vinegar-processed Curcuma zedoaria was more suitable for the treatment of oxidative liver diseases, and epicurzerenone could be considered as its quality marker.

Previous studies show that C. zedoaria active compounds used as anti-proliferative, increasing apoptosis, and anti-metastasis. However, information about the mechanism of the active compound to inhibition of CXCR4 in the carcinogenesis process unknown. CXCR4 is a specific receptor for CXCL12 and known to play an essential role in prognosis and drug target of breast cancer. This research aimed to analyze the effect of C. zedoaria active compounds as breast cancer chemotherapeutic agents through CXCR4 inhibition. Binding affinity value shows that 11 compounds from C. zedoaria have the potential to inhibit CXCR4 with the smallest binding affinity and the same binding site with Chalcone and Epirubicin. However, Stigmasterol, Campesterol, and beta-sitosterol have the lowest binding affinity than the other active compound. Analysis of protein interaction shows that CXCR4 interacts with CXCL12, STAT3, and JAK2. Its protein used as a poor prognosis factor for cancer. These results indicate that C. zedoaria are active compounds and are highly potential as anti-breast cancer. Further research is needed to validate the above data.

The objective of this work was to establish an in vitro protocol for micropropagation and callogenesis of Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe as alternative to improve plant production, turning economically feasible the exploitation of its secondary metabolites which present medicinal properties. Micropropagation by using shoot apexes produced by rhizome and from in vitro plants were carried out on Murashige & Skoog medium supplemented with 2.0 mg L-1 benzyl amino purine and 30 g L-1 sucrose. Plantlets were satisfactorily acclimated to greenhouse conditions by using plastic cover for at least 10 days. Treatment with endomycorrhiza at the ex vitro transferring time was beneficial to acclimatization, improving plant growth and development. Callus induction and growth were obtained by inoculating root segments on Murashige & Skoog medium supplemented with 1.0 mg L-1 naphtalene acetic acid and incubation in the dark at 25+/-2degreesC. Cell suspension cultures were established on liquid medium of same chemical composition and same culture conditions and a growth curve was obtained.

The effects of Curcuma zedoaria and Zingiber zerumbet on non-specific immune responses of grouper Epinephelus coioides	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES			English	Article						Herbs; Immunology; Phagocytosis; Plant extract; White blood cell	TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; ORANGE-SPOTTED GROUPER; DISEASE RESISTANCE; SODIUM ALGINATE; CYPRINUS-CARPIO; EXTRACT; SYSTEM; GROWTH; PURIFICATION; INFECTION	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Curcuma zedoaria and Zingiber zerumbet on non-specific immune responses of grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Fish were fed an experimental diet containing 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 g/kg of C. zedoaria and Z. zerumbet mixed diets twice daily for two weeks. Non-specific immune parameters such as respiratory burst activity, reactive oxygen species, phagocytic activities, superoxidase dismutase activity and lysozyme activity were sampled at 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 days, respectively. Results indicated that in fish fed with C. zedoaria at 0.5 g/kg diet and Z. zerumbet at 1 g/kg and 2.5 g/kg diets the nonspecific immune response was affected, especially in cellular defense which had significant effects in the short term. Thus, this study indicated that C. zedoaria and Z. zerumbet supplemented in the diets of orange-spotted grouper acted as immunostimulants and appeared to enhance the non-specific immune responses in this species.

Curcuma longa and Curcuma zedoaria rhizomes, which are already used in industry to obtain food coloring and pharmaceutical products, may become commercially interesting as starch raw materials. This work aimed to characterize the starch of two Curcuma species. The results revealed that the rhizomes of two species showed low dry matter and high starch contents. The amylose contents of the starches (22% C. longa and 21% C. zedoaria) were similar to potato starch. The results of microscopic analysis showed flat triangular shape and the size was 20-30 mum for two starches. The final viscosity of C longa was high (740 RVU) and the pasting temperature was 81 degreesC. In C. zedoaria the final viscosity was 427 RVU and the pasting temperature was 78 degreesC. These results differed from standard commercially used natural starches. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, CZ-1 and CZ-1-III, the fractions partially purified from C. zedoaria, had a strong, dose-dependent lysosomal enzyme activity. It was suggested that active portions of CZ-1-III were polysaccharides rather than proteins. Phagocytic activity increased as a similar pattern in both the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, time-dependently. It was demonstrated that CZ-1-III can augment the oxygen burst response but had an even higher activity in vivo than in vitro. Also a significant increase of H2O2, NO, and TNF-alpha production was observed. However, the production of TNF-alpha at the concentration of 1,000 mug/ml decreased. These data suggested that C. zedoaria had macro phage-stimulating activity and the possibility of being used as a biological response modifier.

The cytotoxic activity of hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and the methanol-soxhlet extracts of Curcuma zedoaria rhizomes was tested on two human cancer cell lines (Ca Ski and MCF-7) and a noncancer cell line (HUVEC) using MTT assay. Investigation on the chemical components in the hexane and dichloromethane fractions gave 19 compounds, namely, labda-8(17), 12 diene-15,16 dial (1), dehydrocurdione (2), curcumenone (3), comosone II (4), curcumenol (5), procurcumenol (6), germacrone (7), zerumbone epoxide (8), zederone (9), 9-isopropylidene-2,6-dimethyl-11-oxatricyclo[6.2.1.0(1,5)] undec-6-en-8-ol (10), furanodiene (11), germacrone-4,5-epoxide (12), calcaratarin A (13), isoprocurcumenol (14), germacrone-1,10-epoxide (15), zerumin A (16), curcumanolide A (17), curcuzedoalide (18), and gweicurculactone (19). Compounds (1-19) were evaluated for their antiproliferative effect using MTT assay against four cancer cell lines (Ca Ski, MCF-7, PC-3, and HT-29). Curcumenone (3) and curcumenol (5) displayed strong antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 8.3 +/- 1.0 and 9.3 +/- 0.3 mu g/mL, resp.) and were found to induce apoptotic cell death on MCF-7 cells using phase contrast and Hoechst 33342/PI double-staining assay. Thus, the present study provides basis for the ethnomedical application of Curcuma zedoaria in the treatment of breast cancer.

Invertase pathway was identified in the three studied species. Sucrose synthase pathway was also responsible for sucrose metabolism in Curcuma zedoaria and Phaseolus vulgaris cells. Activity values higher than 300 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein were found for acid and neutral invertases, UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase in the cell extract of the three plant species. Sucrose synthase showed low activity in Bauhinia forficata cells. As sucrose concentration in the culture medium decreased, sucrose synthase activity increased in C. zedoaria and P. vulgaris cells. ne glycolytic enzymes activity gradually reduced at the end of the culture period, when carbohydrate was limited.

EOs were obtained by hydrodistillation and chemical characterization was performed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The acaricidal activity of each EO was firstly evaluated on larvae by larval packet test at concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 mg/mL. Through the result of the treatment on larvae, where only the EO from C. zedoaria caused mortality, it was realized the adult immersion tests at concentrations 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, and 80.0 mg/mL for R. microplus engorged females. The GC-MS analysis of EOs showed 1,8-cineole (43.49%), curzerenone (13.40%) and camphor (12.29%) as major components in C. zedoaria, and 4-terpineol (22.27%), 1,8-cineole (16.51%), terpinene (10.75%), p-cymene (9.24%) and sabinene (9.18%) in A. zerumbet. Regarding the acaricidal activity, both in R. microplus larvae and engorged females, only the EO from C. zedoaria was effective, causing 100% larval mortality at a concentration of 15 mg/mL and 98.6% efficacy on engorged females at a concentration of 80 mg/mL. Thus, our results provide support for further investigation of C. zedoaria EO compounds as novel natural products to control R. microplus.

The genus Curcuma, composed of 93 species mainly originating from Asia, Australia, and South America, has been used for medicinal purposes, aromatic, and nutritional values as well as cosmetic. It plays a vital role in flavoring and coloring as well as exhibiting therapeutic agents against different diseases. Nepalese farmers are unaware of the essential oil compositions of Curcuma species, viz. C. aeruginosa, C. zedoaria, and C. longa. The investigation of these three essential oils provides insight into their potential as cash crops and earns a reasonable return from their production. The essential oils were obtained from the rhizomes of each plant by hydrodistillation and subjected to Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify its volatile chemical constituents as well as chiral GC-MS to identify the enantiomeric distribution of chiral terpenoids. The order of extraction yields were C. longa (0.89%) > C. zedoaria (0.74%) > C. aeruginosa (0.37%). In total, the presence of 65, 98, and 84 compounds were identified in C. longa, C. zedoaria, and C. aeruginosa, representing 95.82%, 81.55%, and 92.59% of the total oil, respectively. The most abundant compounds in C. longa essential oils were ar-turmerone (25.5%), oc-turmerone (24.4%), beta-turmerone (14.0%), terpinolene (7.2%), beta-sesquiphellandrene (5.1%), alpha-zingiberene (4.8%), beta-caryophyllene (2.9%), ar-curcumene (1.6%) and 1,8-cineole (1.3%). The most dominant compounds in C. zedoaria were curzerenone (21.5%), 1,8-cineole (19.6%), curzerene (6.2%), trans-beta-Elemene (5.1%), camphor (2.6%), and germacrone (2.3%). The major components in C. aeruginosa were curzerenone (59.6%), germacrone (5.3%), curzerene (4.7%), camphor (3.6%), trans-beta-Elemene (2.6%), and beta-eudesmol (1.6%). C. zedoaria, and C. aeruginosa essential oil from Nepal for the very first time. This study reports for the first time chiral terpenoids from C. aeruginosa, C. zedoaria, and C. longa essential oil. A chemical blueprint of these essential oils could also be used as a tool for identification and quality assessment.

(Zingiberaceae) has been used to treat headache, fever, and hypertension-related symptoms in Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Japan. We investigated whether dietary intake of a C. zedoaria extract (CzE) affected atherosclerosis in vivo. MATERIALS/METHODS: Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice (n = 32) were fed a normal diet (ND), a high-cholesterol diet (HCD), an HCD containing CzE (100 mg/kg/day), or an HCD containing simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. The anti-atherosclerotic effects were evaluated by observing changes in fatty streak lesions, immunohistochemical analysis, ex vivo fluorescence imaging, lipid profiles, and western blot analysis. RESULTS: The CzE-fed group showed a 41.6% reduction of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, CzE significantly reduced the levels of serum triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, the chemokine (C-X3-C-motif) ligand 1, the adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin; down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, high mobility group box-1, and cathepsin levels in the aortic sinuses and aortas of ApoE(-/-) mice were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the inclusion of a water extract of C. zedoaria in a HCD is closely correlated with reducing the risk of vascular inflammatory diseases in an ApoE mouse model.

The data were subjected to response surface methodology (RSM) and the results showed that the polynomial equations for all models were significant, did not show lack of fit, and presented adjusted determination coefficients -(R-2) above 99%, proving their suitability for prediction purposes. Using desirability function, the optimum operating conditions to attain a higher extraction of phenolics and flavonoids was found to be 75 degrees C, 92 min of extraction time and 90: 10 of ethanol concentration ratios. Under these optimal conditions, the experimental values for total phenolics and flavonoids of Curcuma zedoaria leaves were 125.75 +/- 0.17 mg of gallic acid equivalents and 6.12 +/- 0.23 mg quercetin/g of extract, which closely agreed with the predicted values. Besides, in this study, the leaves from Curcuma zedoaria could be considered to have the strong antioxidative ability and can be used in various cosmeceuticals or medicinal applications.

The traditional usages of the plant is not limited to a particular disease but extended over a large number of diseases. Anti-breast cancer activity of ethyl acetate extract of Curcuma zedoaria was conducted on MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line with the help of MTT assay technique and the mechanistic pathway was established with the help of western blot technique, confocal microscopy, wound healing migration assay and cell cycle analysis. Cell cytotoxicity test of ethyl acetate extracts showed remarkable result on MDA-MB231 in dose dependent manner (p < 0.05). Confocal microscopy studies on MDA-MB231 cells revealed the activation of cleaved caspase 9 in treated cells. Western blot analyses confirm the regulation of cytochrome C and suppression of Bcl-2 in treated cells which suggest ethyl acetate extract of Curcuma zedoaria inhibits the cancer cells through cascase-dependent pathways. In cell cycle analysis, after the treatments of the cells; there was an increase in the percentage of SubG(0)/G(1) cells that decreased S and G(2) phase indicating the population undergoing cell death (apoptosis or necrosis) thereby, our data suggest that ethyl acetate extracts were able to induce significant apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells in dose dependent manner. The wound healing migration assay confirms the anti-metastatic nature of the plant extract. With the help one way ANOVA test, all the experiments were executed and it was found that ethyl acetate extract of Curcuma zedoaria inhibits MDA-MB231 cells with the down-regulation of the expression of Bcl-2 through cascase-dependent pathways therefore Curcuma zedoaria is a potent anti-cancer plant especially in breast cancer.

Two-stage culture was initiated when the cell concentration in both vessels was maintained at an appropriate density. The cells were proliferated in stirred-tank with the maximal growth rate of 0.17d(-1) to present enough cells for beta-elemene synthesis. In the airlift column, continuous cell separation from culture medium was achieved by using a cell retention device based on centrifugal and gravity settling when the system was performed in perfusion mode. The results indicated that additives can efficiently promote the accumulation of beta-elemene in R. zedoariae cells. In addition, the beta-elemene content showed higher levels in cell lines of overexpressing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase, Farnesyldi phosphate synthase, and ST02C genes.

Germacrone was converted into several sesquiterpenes, some of which were isolated from the Curcuma spp. plants through, the key intermediate, (4R,5R)-germacrone 4,5-epoxide, and their structures were determined by spectral and chemical evidence. The configurations of some of the derivatives were opposite to those of the sesquiterpenes isolated from the Curcuma sp plants, C. aromatica, C. longa and C. zedoaria. An eudesmane-type product was also isolated and its structure was determined. From the structure, the transformation of germacrone through the intermediate, (1S, 10S)-germacrone 1, 10-epoxide, was supposed and further confirmed by the transformation of germacrone 1, 10-epoxide into the same product by acid treatment. The structures of two new products were also determined and their transformation mechanism through curcumenone and dihydrocurcumenone was deduced.

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a methanolic (MeOH) extract of C. zedoaria rhizomes, as well as its active constituents, against gastric cancer, which is a frequently diagnosed cancer in South Korea. Materials and methods: Repeated column chromatography, together with semi-preparative HPLC purification, was used to separate the bioactive constituents from the C. zedoaria MeOH extract. The cytotoxic effects of the C. zedoaria MeOH extract and its active compounds were measured in human gastric cancer AGS cells. Expression of proteins related to apoptosis was evaluated using Western blotting analysis. Results: The MeOH extract of C. zedoaria rhizomes exerted a cytotoxic effect on AGS cells (IC50: 96.60 +/- 4.87 mu g/mL). Based on the bioactivity-guided fractionation for antiproliferative activity, a chemical investigation of the MeOH extract led to the isolation of five sesquiterpenes including isoprocurcumenol (1), germacrone (2), curzerenone (3), curcumenol (4), and curcuzedoalide (5). Among these, curcuzedoalide demonstrated the strongest effect in suppressing gastric cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 125.11 +/- 2.77 mu M. Western blotting analysis showed that curcuzedoalide inhibited AGS human gastric cancer cell viability by activating caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP, which contributed to apoptotic cell death in AGS human gastric cancer cells. Conclusion: These data indicate that curcuzedoalide contributed to the cytotoxicity of C. zedoaria by activating the cleavage of caspases and PARP, which are representative markers for apoptosis. Therefore, curcuzedoalide is. a positive candidate for the development of novel chemotherapeutics.

In this study, methanol extracts of 120 plants were explored for in vivo antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora infestans, Puccinia triticina, and Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. Of the 120 plant extracts, eight plant extracts exhibited a disease control efficacy of more than 90% against at least one of five plant diseases. In particular, a methanol extract of Curcuma zedoaria rhizomes exhibited strong activity against wheat leaf rust caused by P. triticina. When the C. zedoaria methanol extracts were partitioned with various solvents, the layers of n-hexane, methylene chloride, and ethyl acetate showed disease control values of 100, 80, and 43%, respectively, against wheat leaf rust. From the C. zedoaria rhizome extracts, an antifungal substance was isolated and identified as a sesquiterpene ketolactone based on the mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral data. The active compound controlled the development of rice sheath blight, wheat leaf rust, and tomato late blight. Considering the in vivo antifungal activities of the sesquiterpene ketolactone and the C. zedoaria extracts, these results suggest that C. zedoaria can be used as a potent fungicide in organic agriculture.

Roscoe (white turmeric) is a perennial herbaceous plant of family Zingiberaceae and mainly found in the wild areas of tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The cytochrome proteins in plants play important roles in promoting their growth and development, as well as protecting them from stresses and diseases. Cytochrome proteins like psbF, psbE, petB, petD, petN, petG and ccsA play important roles in degradation of misfolded proteins, ATP formation, cyclic electron flow and biogenesis of c-type cytochrome of C. zedoaria. However, due to lack of structural availability of these C. zedoaria cytochrome proteins in structural databases, the physiochemical parameters of sequences were estimated using Expasy ProtParam web tool. Self-Optimized Prediction Method with Alignment (SOPMA) server and MODELLER version 9.23 were used for modelling along with Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN) and Protein Structure Analysis (ProSA) servers were implemented for validating the secondary and tertiary structures of these proteins. The obtained QMEAN4 values of the modelled cytochrome proteins were -2.04, -1.20, -3.01, -1.57, -2.11, 1.74 and -12.87. The Z-scores obtained from ProSA server were 0.5, -0.83, 1.5, -0.58, -0.02, 0.14 and -3.73. All seven modelled structures have been submitted to protein model database (PMDB). The derived results will be helpful in further investigations towards determining the crystal structure of the hypothetical proteins, structural motifs, physiochemical properties and also protein-protein interaction studies of various cytochrome proteins.

Roscoe after several days of plant dormancy release. Rhizomes of C. zedoaria were immersed in four kinetin concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150 mg ml(-1), n = 12 by each concentration) for 30 min. After 240 h of treatment, root length (mm), bud break (%) and bud speed index (BSI) were measured, and three rhizomes at 24 h and 240 h were collected for chemical volatile profile analysis by application of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Kinetin does not alter morphological aspects of the bud dormancy releasing, but drastically changes metabolic aspects of volatile production on C. zedoaria rhizomes, by the selection of several monoterpenes, such as camphene, sabinene, isoborneol, borneol, 1,8-cineole. We assume that kinetin application maintain monoterpene production as a consequence of its signaling over dormancy release.

Roscoe and its nomenclatural history are explained. Roscoe wrongly interpreted the basionym of this name and applied his combination to a different taxon, which is not even involved in Christmann's protologue. The first lectotypification applied the name to the species upon which Rheede's description of Kua was based. Study of living material reveals that the name C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe is currently applied to several Superficially similar taxa in different parts of India and SE Asia and there are 110 grounds to propose conservation of the name with a different type. To avoid more confusion, the identity of the plant representing C. zedoaria in the sense lectotypified by Burtt (1977) is explained here and a colour plate depicting its morphology is provided. The plant described and depicted by Roxburgh as Curcuma zerumbet Roxb., a name usually cited among synonyms of C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe, is found to represent the taxon that Roscoe had in mind while publishing his combination C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe. Curcuma zerumbet Roxb. is illegitimate, however, and as there is no other name available for this taxon it is described here as Curcuma picta. The nomenclatural history of Amomum zerumbet. Konig nom. illeg. and Erndlia subpersonata Giseke, names which are involved in the illegitimacy of C. zerumbet Roxb., is explained.

The activity-guided fractionation and repetitive chromatographic procedures with the EtOAc-soluble fraction resulted in the isolation of three active compounds. They were identified as 1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (1). procurcumenol (2) and epiprocurcumenol (3) by spectral data analysis. They inhibited the production of TNF-a by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages from the results of bioassay (IC50 values of 1 and 2 are 12.3 and 310.5 muM, respectively) and Western blot assay. These results imply that the traditional use of C. zedoaria rhizome as anti-inflammatory drug may be explained at least in part, by the inhibition of TNF-alpha production.

Inhibiting activities against cell proliferation, invasion and colony formation, and expression levels of corresponding molecules were investigated using human esophageal cancer TE-8 cells treated with the rhizome extract from C. zedoaria. Antitumor effect of the extract administered orally was also examined in tumor-bearing mice. The extract possessed strong anti-proliferation and invasion activities against TE-8 cells. Further, upregulated PTEN and downregulated phosphorylated Akt, mTOR and STAT3 expressions in the cells were induced shortly after treatment with the extract, followed by attenuation of FGFR1 and MMP-2, activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP, and suppression of Bcl-2 expressions, which led the cells to apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, tumor formation in mice was significantly suppressed through the oral administration of the extract. Taken together, these results suggest that the C. zedoaria extract could be a promising agent against esophageal cancer.

Rosc. were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and showed a high content of epicurzerenone and curdione representing 46.6% and 13.7% of the total oil, respectively. The essential oil was evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasa aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus. V parahaemolyticus was sensitive to the presence of the essential oil, while the most resistant strain appeared to be E. coli. Based on 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and cell morphology, the essential oil of C zedoaria could inhibit the proliferation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the essential oil has the antimicrobial activity against some of Gram-positive and negative pathogenic microorganisms and the components of the extract lead to the apoptosis of human cancer cell line.

Rosc. (Zingiberaceae) has long been used as a folk medicine. The essential oil of its dried rhizome was isolated using simultaneous steam-distillation and solvent-extraction apparatus and its fractions were prepared by silica gel column chromatography. Totally, 36 compounds were identified in the essential oil, including 17 terpenes, 13 alcohols and 6 ketones. The yields of Fractions 2 and 3 were 83.66 and 10.71%, respectively. Epicurzerenone and curzerene were found in the first and second highest amounts (24.1 and 10.4%). At 20 mg ml(-1), the essential oil of C. zedoaria was moderate to good in antioxidant activities by three different methods, good in reducing power and excellent in scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical but low in chelating effect on ferrous ion. However, after fractionation, with regard to all antioxidant properties assayed, fraction 4 showed consistently better effects than the essential oil did. The compound in fraction 4 responsible for better antioxidant properties might be 5-isopropylidene-3,8-dimethyl-1(5H)-azulenone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rosc., a traditional Chinese herb, was used widely but absolutely prohibited for the pregnant in clinic. Based on that there is abundant angiogenesis in endometrium and placenta during gestation period, we hypothesized that some components from it could inhibit angiogenesis and then damaged the supply of oxygen and nutrition to the embryo, which finally led to gestation failure. Aim of the study: This study was set to demonstrate whether essential oil, major components of Curcuma zedoaria had anti-angiogenic effect. Materials and methods: Essential oil of Curcuma zedoaria (EO-CZ) was abstracted by steam distillation extraction. Cell proliferation assay and two angiogenic models, rat aortic ring assay and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay were presented. Furthermore, melanoma growth and experimental lung metastasis assay in mice were performed to evaluate its anti-angiogenesis effect in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to respectively detect the expression of CD34 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Results: EO-CZ exhibited anti-proliferative effect on B16BL6 and SMMC-7721 cells, the IC50, respectively was 41.8 mu g/ml and 30.71 mu g/ml, and on HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) cells with IC50 of far more than 120 mu g/ml. Both 20 mu g/ml and 40 mu g/ml EO-CZ indicated significant suppression on sprouting vessels of aortic ring and formation of microvessels in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane in vitro. Moreover, solid melanoma grown in left oxter of mice was obviously inhibited after oral intake of 100 and 200 mg/kg of EO-CZ a day for 28 days, and CD34 expression indicating angiogenesis in melanoma reduced significantly compared with control; melanoma metastatic nodules in lung were detected to be inhibited, as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in serum. Conclusions: Essential oil, a fat-soluble fraction of Curcuma zedoaria, presented anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo, resulting in suppressing melanoma growth and lung metastasis. And this was associated with down-regulating MMPs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Roscoe collected from Malaysia and Indonesia were analyzed by capillary GC and GC-MS. Both the oils were principally sesquiterpenic in nature and were characterized by zerumbone (17.14 % and 12.07 %, respectively). Camphor (17.56 % and 19.69 %, respectively) was also abundant in both oils. The cytotoxic effects of both the oils on human breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231), lung (A549 and SK-LU-1) and cervical (HeLa S3 and SiHa) cancer cell lines were examined using the MTT assay. The Malaysian C. zedoaria rhizome oil was found to be cytotoxic against the MCF-7, SK-LU-1, HeLa S3 and SiHa cell lines, with IC50 values being less than 10 mu g/mL. Our findings support the use of the Malaysian C. zedoaria rhizome oil as a potential chemopreventive agent towards a wide spectrum of cancer in particular cervical cancer.

Each plant is a unique chemical factory capable of synthesizing unlimited numbers of highly complex and unusual chemical substances whose structures could otherwise escape the imagination forever. Phytomedicines have been used as a treatment for many diseases, ranging from skin disease to cancer. Most of the anticancer drugs that we use today are derived from plants. The anticancer effect of plants is due to specific phytochemicals or the complex synergistic interactions among their various constituents. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic properties of an extract of the Curucuma zedoariae rhizome, a plant belonging to the family Zingeberaceae, and to determine its IC50 value. Various organic extracts were isolated using Soxhlet apparatus in order of increasing solvent polarity, namely petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol. Colorimetric [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay (MTT assay) was done to determine the cytotoxicity against human cervical carcinoma cells (He La). Acridine orange-ethidium dromide dual staining and DNA fragmentation assays were done to detect apoptotic features. Among the various extracts studied, the petroleum ether extract was found to exhibit maximum cytotoxicity against He La cells. Our results suggest that the petroleum ether extract of the Curucuma zedoariae rhizome may have potential as an anticancer agent. Further steps have to be done to purify the compound and to elucidate the antitumor activity of the extract.	[Lakshmi, S.; Dhanya, G.

The bioactive compounds contained in the medicinal plants are products by the plant itself or by endophytes living inside the plant. Zebrafish has been used for the study in several areas of cancer research, including angiogenesis, metastasis, antitumor drug screening, and toxicity. This study was to investigate the antimicrobial and toxicity activity of secondary metabolite from endophytic bacteria isolated from C. zedoaria. Endophytic isolates were screened for antimicrobial activities against six microbial pathogens Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae. Four of endophytic bacteria showed antimicrobial activity were tested in toxic compound producing through Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test using zebrafish. The results indicated that from 73 selected isolates, 16 isolates (21.92%) showed antimicrobial activities against at least one of the test organisms. Four of endophytic bacteria that showed high antimicrobial activities, were identified as Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas otitidis, and Burkholderia cenocepacia. FET test of ethyl acetate extracts from the four those selected isolates revealed that they had LCso values 63.5; 24.7; 13.4; and 12.6 ppm, respectively. These result showed that the highest toxicity was obtained from B. cenocepacia extract.	[Sulistiyani, T.

The immersion period in TIS did not influence shoot multiplication rates of both species. However, proliferation medium ( MS plus 0.5 mg/L BA and 0.5 mg/L IBA) supplemented with different sucrose concentration affected the production of multiple shoots but did not affect the fresh and dried shoot biomass for both species when using TIS. The TIS was able to eliminate hyperhydricity problem encountered when using the shake flask system. However, all the in vitro plantlets of both species produced by the three culture systems survived and grew normally with no morphological changes after acclimatization. This study indicated that TIS was the best choice of in vitro propagation technique for production of normal C. zedoaria and Z. zerumbet plantlets.

Axillary bud explants of C. zedoaria were inoculated into MS basal medium supplemented with various combinations and concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (2.2-22.2 mu M, BA), kinetin (2.3-23.2 mu M, Kin), indole-3-acetic acid (2.9-11.4 mu M, IAA), alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (2.7-10.2 mu M, NAA) and adenine sulphate (33.9-203.6 mu M, Ads). Almost 95% of rhizome buds sprouted on MS medium supplemented with 13.3 mu M BA, 5.7 mu M IAA and 63.9 mu M Ads giving rise to an average of 12.89 +/- 0.02 shoots within 6 weeks. However, the maximum number of roots (25.8 +/- 0.07 roots per explant) was obtained on half strength MS medium supplemented with 7.4 mu M of IBA after 4 weeks of inoculation. Morphological characteristics were similar in both conventionally propagated and micropropagated plants. Additionally, genetic homogeneity of in vitro plants was further confirmed through ISSR and flow cytometry analysis. A total of 27 ISSR primers were screened, out of which 13 ISSR primers generated 58 monomorphic and reproducible bands thereby confirming the genetic uniformity of obtained plants. The mean 2C DNA content of the mother plant (2.96 pg) was similar to that of in vitro derived plants (3.07 pg). Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed similarity in the qualitative profile of chemical constituents of essential oil and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed no significant differences in curcumin content in the tissue culture regenerants and mother plants of C. zedoaria. Therefore, the present micropropagation protocol could be effectively employed to generate true to type plantlets of C. zedoaria.

Alismol has never been reported to be present in Curcuma zedoaria. All isolated compounds except (3) were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against MCF-7, Ca Ski, and HCT-116 cancer cell lines and noncancer human fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) using neutral red cytotoxicity assay. Curzerenone and alismol significantly inhibited cell proliferation in human cancer cell lines MCF-7, Ca Ski, and HCT-116 in a dose-dependent manner. Cytological observations by an inverted phase contrast microscope and Hoechst 33342/PI dual-staining assay showed typical apoptotic morphology of cancer cells upon treatment with curzerenone and alismol. Both compounds induce apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3. It can thus be suggested that curzerenone and alismol are modulated by apoptosis via caspase-3 signalling pathway. The findings of the present study support the use of Curcuma zedoaria rhizomes in traditional medicine for the treatment of cancer-related diseases. Thus, two naturally occurring sesquiterpenoids, curzerenone and alismol, hold great promise for use in chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies.

Dryer efficiency, specific energy consumption and drying rate are studied. The overall dryer efficiency of mixed mode (MFSCD) is 26.5% higher than indirect mode (IFSCD) solar dryer. Two term model and Verma model fit best for Curcuma zedoaria drying in MFSCD and IFSCD, respectively, and Logarithmic model is quite suitable for open sun drying (OSD). The effective moisture diffusivity of the product dried under MFSCD is highest as compared to IFSCD and OSD products. The quality analyses show that higher values of TFC (78.11 mg GAE/g of sample) and DPPH (120.56 mu mol of TE/g of sample) are reported in the samples dried in MFSCD as compared to IFSCD and OSD samples. Practical applications Conventional open sun drying is a common practice followed by small farmers for drying herbs and spices. Products dried under open sun lose their nutritional and medicinal values due to slow drying rate and improper heating. The present work focusses on the development of a low cost solar dryer for drying of high value medicinal herbs like Curcuma zedoaria, curcuma caesia, and black cardamom. Study of drying kinetics helps in improving the design aspects of solar dryer and optimization of the drying systems. Drying time of the Curcuma zedoaria dried in the developed dryer is about 60% less than the open sun drying and the retention of color, antioxidant, and texture of the solar dried products is excellent. The developed solar dryer will be suitable for small small-scale farmers and can be scaled up to any size.	[Lakshmi, Durga V.

The polysaccharide fraction, CZ-I-III, at dose of 6.25 mg/kg/d showed 50% inhibition in solid tumor growth. When mice were injected with fractions, CZ-l and CZ-l-m, at the dose of 100.0 mg/kg, 91.6% and 97.1% of tumor growth were inhibited, respectively, indicating that the cytotoxic effect of polysaccharide on sarcoma 180 cells increases upon increasing the amount of polysaccharide administered. To assess the genotoxicity of CZ-1-III fraction, several classical toxicological tests were performed. In Ames test, CZ-1-III did not show any transformation of revertant with or without S-9 metabolic activating system, indicating the lack of mutagenic effect of the compound. To assess clastogenic effect, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays were performed using Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblast cells, However up to 259.0 mu g/ml concentration of CZ-1-III, neither micronucleus formation nor chromosomal aberration was induced regardless of the presence of S-9 metabolic activating system. Inhibition of CZ-l-m on micronucleus formation induced by mitomycin C was exhibited in a dose-dependent manner, maximally up to 52.0%. These results strongly suggest that CZ-1-III, the polysaccharide fraction from C, Zedoaria, decreases tumor size of mouse and prevents chromosomal mutation.

The analysis was carried out by high resolution gas chromatography, using external standards for determination. The results showed that both terpenoids are present in all the parts studied. However, C. zedoaria exhibited about three times more terpenoids in the mother rhizome in autumn than in other parts and seasons studied. The antinociceptive activity of the dichloromethane extracts from different parts and collected in different seasons was studied using the acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction model in mice. The extracts obtained from mother rhizome collected in autumn and winter at doses of 10 mg/kg body weight, i.p., caused considerable antinociceptive activity inhibiting 91.1 and 93.4% of the abdominal constrictions, respectively, whereas compounds 1 and 2 caused inhibitions of 64.0 and 46.0%, respectively. These results confirm that both compounds contribute to explain the antinociceptive effect of the plant but suggest that other compounds are also acting as analgesics.

The methanolic extracts of the plants were dissolved in the water (distilled) separately and then partitioned with the n-hexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and n-BuOH sequentially. Antibacterial activity was checked against Escherichia coli, Pasturella multocida, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus by the disc diffusion method using streptomycin sulphate, a standard antibiotic, as positive control. Antifungal activity was studied against four fungi i.e. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Ganoderma lucidum and Alternaria alternata by the disc diffusion method using fluconazole, a standard antifungal drug, as positive control. It was revealed that aqueous fraction of F. indica showed very good antibacterial activity against P. multocida with zone of inhibition 26mm and MIC of 98 mu g/mL. Its CHCl3 and n-BuOH fractions also displayed good results. Its CHCl3 fraction showed good antifungal activity against G. lucidum with zone of inhibition 24mm and MIC of 115 mu g/mL. Other polar fractions of F. indica showed good activity against somefungal strains. The CHCl3 and EtOAc fractions of D. bupleuroides displayed good antibacterial activity against some bacterial strains. Its EtOAc fraction showed good antifungal activity only against G lucidum. The CHCl3 fraction of C. zedoaria showed good activity against all studied bacterial strains, while its EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions displayed good results against some bacterial strains. None of the fractions of C. zedoaria displayed antifungal activity against the under test strains. All the studied fractions of three plants showed very less toxicity except n-hexane fraction of D. bupleuroides which showed 79% toxicity.

The in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of plant extracts and commercial products were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans using a linear regression method to evaluate the microbial reduction obtained in function of the exposure time, considering as effectiveness a 99.999% reduction in count of standardized microbial populations within 60 seconds. The results showed that the antimicrobial efficacy of Curcuma zedoaria ( Christm) Roscoe extract was similar to that of commercial products, and its incorporation into a mouthrinse could be an alternative for improving the antimicrobial efficacy of the oral product.

We used extraction with 20 mM phosphate buffer, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75, and reverse-phase HPLC. The purified lectin yielded a single band on SIDS-PAGE that corresponded to a molecular mass of 13 kDa. This lectin exhibited hemagglutinating activity toward rabbit erythrocytes, which could be inhibited by mannose only. The lectin was digested with trypsin and its digests were analyzed using MALDI-TOF/TOF. Partial amino acid sequences were obtained from tandem mass spectra via automated de novo sequencing, and were then identified by MS-BLAST homology searches to enable recognition of related proteins in other species. inferred peptide sequences exhibited similarity to a mannose-binding lectin from Epipactis helleborine, a member of the Orchidaceae.

J	Jang, MK; Lee, HJ; Kim, JS; Ryu, JH				Jang, MK; Lee, HJ; Kim, JS; Ryu, JH			A curcuminoid and two sesquiterpenoids from Curcuma zedoaria as inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis in activated macrophages	ARCHIVES OF PHARMACAL RESEARCH			English	Article						nitric oxide synthase; inhibitor; Curcuma zedoaria; curcuminoid; sesquiterpene	GAJUTSULACTONE-B; ZEDOAROLIDE-B; SYNTHASE; RHIZOMA; NEOCURCUMENOL; SUPPRESSION; RAW-264.7; ENZYME	The overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is known to be responsible for vasodilation and hypotension observed in septic shock and inflammation. Inhibitors of iNOS, thus, may be useful candidates for the treatment of inflammatory diseases accompanied by overproduction of NO. In the course of screening oriental anti-inflammatory herbs for the inhibitory activity of NO synthesis, a crude methanolic extract of Curcuma zedoaria exhibited significant activity. The activity-guided fractionation and repetitive chromatographic procedures with the EtOAc soluble fraction allowed us to isolate three active compounds. They were identified as 1,7-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (1), procurcumenol (2) and epiprocurcumenol (3) by spectral data analyses. Their concentrations for the 50% inhibition of NO production (IC50) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages were 8, 75, 77 muM, respectively. Compound 1 showed the most potent inhibitory activity for NO production in LPS-activated macrophages, while the epimeric isomers, compound 2 and 3 showed weak and similar potency. Inhibition of NO synthesis by compound 1 was very weak when activated macrophages were treated with 1 after iNOS induction. In the immunoblot analysis, compound 1 suppressed the expression of iNOS in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, 1,7-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one from Curcuma zedoaria inhibited NO production in LPS-activated macrophages through suppression of iNOS expression. These results imply that the traditional use of C. zedoaria rhizome as anti-inflammatory drug may be explained at least in part, by inhibition of NO production.

Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe (Zingiberaceae), an indigenous plant of India, has been used traditionally in Ayurveda and folk medicine. As part of our ongoing efforts to screen traditional medicinal plants exhibiting pharmacological potential and to characterize the compounds involved, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of the MeOH extract of C. zedoaria rhizomes using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and found that MeOH extract inhibited the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50: 23.44 +/- 0.77 mu g/mL). In our efforts to characterize the compounds responsible for these anti-inflammatory effects, bioactivity-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract and chemical investigation of its active hexane-soluble fraction led to the successful isolation of five sesquiterpenes (1-5), the structures of which were elucidated by NMR spectroscopic analysis and LC/MS analysis. Among them, curcuzedoalide (5) exhibited potent inhibitory effects on NO synthesis (IC50: 12.21 +/- 1.67 mu M) and also suppressed pre-inflammatory protein expression of iNOS and COX-2. Curcuzedoalide (5) was thus determined to be a contributor to the anti-inflammatory effect of C. zedoaria rhizomes and could be a potential candidate for therapeutic applications.

J	Tinrat, S				Tinrat, Sirikhwan			Preliminary phytochemical analysis, antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe extracts	MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Phytochemical screening; antibacterial activity; anti-biofilm activity; Curcuma zedoaria; time-kill curves	ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; STEM	Aims: Plant extracts are a rich source of natural compounds that have some degree of antimicrobial efficacy and have less side effects compared to antibiotics. The aim of this research was to screen the phytochemical compounds and investigate the potency of Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe rhizome (CZR) extracts to inhibit the growth and biofilm formation of some pathogenic bacteria. Methodology and results: Antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of CZR extracts in different solvents were examined by agar well diffusion and the broth microdilution method after phytochemical screening. The 95% ethanolic extract of CZR exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial properties against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with inhibition zones of 7.25 +/- 0.58-12.00 +/- 0.26 mm and MIC values ranging from 50-200 mg/mL. The extract also showed rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities towards Enterococcus faecalis DMST 4736 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 by time-kill assays. Moreover, the 95% ethanolic extracts of CZR also acted as a potent anti-biofilm agent against E. faecalis DMST 4736, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Proteus mirabilis DMST 8212 (54.62 +/- 0.30-71.25 +/- 0.20% inhibition of biofilm formation). The bioactive potency of compounds of the crude 95% ethanolic extract (tannins, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, terpenoids and alkaloids) play important roles in the observed antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe extract had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The ethanolic CZR extract revealed bacteriostatic and bactericidal capacities, depending on time of exposure and concentration of the extracts. Thus, the present results indicate that C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe rhizomes are a potential natural alternative antibacterial agent for preventing bacterial diseases.

The rhizomes were collected during dormancy (winter) and budding (summer). The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation (2h) and identified by GC/MS. In addition, a multivariate exploratory analysis was done to determine the analysis of the major compounds (PCA). The EO yield in dormancy was 0.61 +/- 0.07 (%) and in budding 0.55 +/- 0.08 (%). The bioassays on Aedes aegypti larvae and pupae were done by immersion test at different EO concentrations which ranged from 500.00 to 0.003 mg mL(-1) (v/v). The results on the larvae and pupae indicated LC99.9 of (0.01 and 1.38 mg mL(-1)) for EO in dormancy, and (0.08 and 2.63 mg mL(-1)) for EO during budding, respectively. The action mechanism of EOs in both periods was determined by autobiographic method evaluating the inhibitory potential on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, indicating greater inhibition of the EO enzyme during dormancy (0.039 mg mL(-1)) when compared to the EO during budding (0.156 mg mL(-1)). The projection representation of the EO chemical classes in both evaluated periods indicated that oxygenated sesquiterpenes are the major compound class (46.99% in dormancy) and (43.59% in budding). The projection of major chemical compounds of EOs presented three compounds with greater mass flow distancing: epicurzerenone (18.20% and 12.10%); 1.8 cineole (15.76% and 12.10%) and beta-elemene (4.43 and 0.01%) that are found in greater amounts in the dormancy EO when compared to budding, respectively. These results corroborate with the greater potential on Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae found for the dormancy EO. The results are promising because they show in which vegetative cycle phase C. zedoaria EO presents greater bioinsecticide potential.

So far, the content of each curcuminoid in the rhizome extract of C. zedoaria in Thailand has not been reported. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated for quantitative analysis of curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin) content in 70% ethanolic extracts of the rhizomes of C. zedoaria collected from 10 different locations in Thailand. The method demonstrated good linearity, precision and accuracy. The content of curcumin in all crude extracts was found in the range of 1.46 +/- 0.45 to 5.73 +/- 0.11 % w/w (average 2.73 +/- 1.24 % w/w) whereas the contents of demethoxycurcumin, which is a major component, and of bisdemethoxycurcumin were in the ranges of 3.15 +/- 0.15 to 10.98 +/- 0.28 % w/w (average 7.37 +/- 2.71 % w/w) and 0.49 +/- 0.02-2.99 +/- 0.20 % w/w (average 1.40 +/- 0.82 % w/w) respectively. The highest average total curcuminoids content in the crude extracts was 16.83 +/- 0.62 % w/w whereas the lowest content was 6.09 +/- 1.79 % w/w. This information will be useful as a guidance for further standardization of C. zedoaria raw material and extracts. Free radical scavenging activity of all extracts was determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay. Values of EC50 of all extracts were found in the range of 18.29 +/- 0.05 to 40.33 +/- 2.24 mu g/ml (average 25.71 +/- 7.54 mu g/ml). Free radical scavenging activity of the separated pure compounds was found in descending order of curcumin > demethoxycurcumin > bisdemethoxycurcumin.

Quantitative analysis of curcuminoids in Curcuma zedoaria rhizomes in Thailand by HPLC method	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTS	ACTA HORTICULTURAE		English	Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Medicinal and Aromatic Plants	JAN 15-18, 2007	Chiang Mai, THAILAND			curcumin; demethoxycurcumin; bisdemethoxycurcumin; steam distillation; liquid chromatography		A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed and validated for quantitative determination of curcuminoid (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin) contents in extracts of the rhizomes of Curcuma zedoaria collected from ten locations in Thailand. The analysis was carried out using a BDS Hypersil C-18 column as a stationary phase, 0.1% glacial acetic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile as mobile phases. The detection was done at 425 nm. The validation using curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin as standards demonstrated good linearity, precision and accuracy at the concentration range of 2-6 mu g/ml. The content of curcumin in all powdered samples was in the range of 0.50 +/- 0.06 to 0.73 +/- 0.03% w/w (average 0.65 +/- 0.07% w/w) while the contents of demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin were in the range of 0.23 +/- 0.02 to 1.43 +/- 0.55% w/w (average 0.91 +/- 0.35% w/w) and 0.12 +/- 0.01 to 0.44 +/- 0.21% w/w (average 0.25 +/- 0.10% w/w), respectively. The highest average total curcuminoid content in the powdered samples was found to be 2.50 +/- 0.52% w/w while the lowest content was 1.06 +/- 0.31% w/w. This information will be useful as guidance for further standardization of C zedoaria raw material of which the content has not been reported before.

However, efficient identification of active molecules responsible for the therapeutic effects of complex TCMs is still highly challenging. Here, we combined label-free cell phenotypic assay with two dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) to identify potential beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) agonists related to anti-asthmatic effect of Curcuma zedoaria Rosc (C.zedoaria), a commonly used TCM. The ethyl acetate extract of C.zedoaria was first fractionated into 26 fractions. Label free cell phenotypic profiling was then used to locate the active sites. Orthogonal second-dimensional (D2) separation was performed on two fractions displaying agonistic effect at the beta(2)-AR, combined with screening of the D2 fractions to track the activity. Finally, this approach led to the isolation of three known diarylheptanoids, among which diarylheptanoid b exhibited the most potent agonistic activity with an EC50 value of 5.93 mu M. This result was further demonstrated through the chemical synthesis of diarylheptanoid b. It is the first time to discover that diarylheptanoids could activate the beta(2)-AR, which may be responsible for the anti -asthmatic effect of C.zedoaria observed traditionally and in clinical application. This study also demonstrates the potential of this integrated strategy for identifying active ingredients and determining the basis of therapeutic materials in complex TCMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It was firstly authenticated that curcumenol derived from C. zedoaria showed higher and broad-spectrum antifungal activity against fungal phytopathogens, such as Fusarium graminearum, Phoma wasabiae, Plasmodiophora brassicae and Magnaporthe grisea while their minimal inhibition concentration were 0.5 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 mg mL(-1), respectively. The antifungal activity was not affected by high or low pH values (from 2-10) or under different temperatures (from 30-80 degrees C). Its antifungal mechanism was further investigated by comparing the ultrastructures of the experimental fungi using scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope and results showed that its antifungal activity was realized by means of destroying the cell-wall and influencing the nutrients circulation of the fungal phytopathogens.

Antifungal activity of the extract of Curcuma zedoaria against yeasts of the genus Candida isolated from the oral cavity of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FARMACOGNOSIA-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOGNOSY			English	Article						Curcuma zedoaria; antifungal activity; oral candidosis; Candida albicans		Oropharyngeal candidiasis is the most common fungal infection among patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and is treated empirically with topical or systemic antifungals. The objective of the present study was to investigate the possible antifungal action of the hydroalcoholic extract of Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe, Zingiberaceae, on yeasts in this population. Samples were collected from HIV-positive patients who attended the Laboratory for Teaching and Research in Clinical Analysis at the Universidade Estadual de Maringa for routine exams. The isolated yeasts were identified at the genus and species levels through classical methodology. Next, tests of microdilution in broth were carried out to determine the profile of susceptibility of these yeasts towards the hydroalcoholic extract of C. zedoaria, following methodology standardised by the CLSI (2002). A total of 53 yeasts were identified, 49 of them C. albicans, two C. tropicalis and two C. glabrata. These yeasts were inhibited by low concentrations of the extract of C. zedoaria (between 1.95 and 15.63 mu g/mL). In addition, 7.82 mu g/mL inhibited 90% of the yeasts. Our results indicate a potent antifungal action for C. zedoaria and suggest more detailed studies with a view towards the practical application of this phytomedicine in topical pharmaceutical forms for the treatment of oral candidosis or candidiasis.

The objectives of this study were to isolate secondary metabolites from methanol fraction of rhizome and to identify the compounds using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The methanol extract yield was 20%. Fractionation using radial chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography produced fractions 3A(1) and 3A(2) which were then analyzed using GC-MS. As many as 47 compounds were identified in fraction 3A(1) including two predicted compounds, namely lippifoli-1(6)-en-4 beta-ol-5-one (I) and 2-benzo-thiazole-2-thiol (II). The compounds identified in fraction 3A2 were as many as 58, including compounds predicted as alpha-cyperone (III), mandolin A (IV), 1,6-dimethyl-9-(1-methylethylidene)-5,12-dioxatricyclododecan-8-one (V), and benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b']dipyran-3,6-dione-2,2-dimethyl (VI).

From the extract, two new carabrane-type sesquiterpenes, curcarabranols A and B, were isolated together with a few carabrane-type sesquiterpenes, such as curcumenone and 4S-dihydrocurcumenone. Their absolute stereostructures were determined on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence, which included the application of the modified Mosher's method and chemical conversion from curcumenone to curcarabranols A and B. In addition, several sesquiterpenes and diaryl-heptanoids (e.g. germacrone, glechomanolide, isocurucmenol, beta -eudesmol, and beta -dictyopterol) showed potent inhibitory effects on contractions induced by high concentrations of K+ in isolated rat aortic strips (inhibition > 80% at 100 muM), while they did not inhibit norepinephrine-induced contractions, so that the vasorelaxant activities of these sesquiterpenes were presumed to be dependent on their calcium channel-blocking activity.

Since current treatments mainly rely on the application of toxic or unapproved chemicals, there is an urgent need to identify new anthelmintic agents. In the present study, in vivo anthelminthic activities of 33 selected medicinal plants were investigated against Gyrodactylus kobayashii, a monogenean parasite infecting goldfish (Carassius auratus). The screening results showed that the methanol extracts of Curcuma zedoaria and Peucedanum praeruptontm had the highest activity against G. kobayashii. The concentration required to kill all parasites of two extracts was both 30 mg/L within 48 h of exposure, while C. zedoaria methanol extract showed lower toxicity to goldfish and was selected for the next study. Subsequently, two major sesquiterpene compounds from C. zedoaria, curdione and curcumenol were further tested for anthelminthic efficacy. The results revealed that only curdione demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antiparasitic effects, 12 mg/L killed 87.04% of G. kobayashii after 2 h in in vitro trials. And bathing G. kobayashii-infected goldfish in curdione induced significant reduction in a total worm burden, with EC50 values of 1.323 and 0.885 mg/L after 24 and 48-h immersion, respectively, and 100% efficacy was achieved at a concentration of 4.0 mg/L after 48 h. Furthermore, to gain insight into the plausible mechanism of anthelminthic activity of curdione, its effects on the ultrastructural alterations of G. kobayashii were performed in vivo by SEM which displayed obvious tegumental damages. Further confirmation of the significant declines of ATP contents in worms were obtained after both in vitro and in vivo treatments with curdione. These findings indicated that curdione mediated worm killing was associated with tegumental damages and energy insufficient. The results suggested that curdione has the potential as an alternative natural compound for the control of Gyrodactylus infections.

We examined the effects of various fractions and isolated compounds on alcohol-induced drunkenness and blood alcohol concentrations in mice. The 30% ethanol-extract (1000 mg/kg) of C. zedoaria rhizome prevented drunkenness 60 and 120 min after 40% alcohol administration. The n-hexane-soluble fraction (300 mg/kg) and an isolated compound (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) prevented drunkenness at 30, 60 or 120 min. The extract, n-hexane-soluble fraction and isolated compound reduced the elevation in blood alcohol concentrations 30 and 60 min after 40% alcohol administration. The isolated compound (10 and 30 mg/kg) enhanced liver ADH activity 30 and 60 min after 40% alcohol administration. The compound was identified as curcumenone by a direct comparison of H-1- and C-13-NMR spectral data. In conclusion, the protective effect of the C. zedoaria extract on drunkenness might be due to an active substance, curcumenone, and decreases in the elevation of blood alcohol concentrations through increased liver alcohol dehydrogenase activity.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of medicinal plants on halitosis control. Two commonly used plants were tested: Curcuma zedoaria and Camellia sinensis (green tea). These plants were prepared as an aqueous solution and used as mouthwashes, compared with a standard mouthwash of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate and a placebo (water). The experiment was conducted with 30 volunteers from the School of Dentistry of Sao Jose dos Campos, Univ. Estadual Paulista - UNESP, SP, Brazil. Each volunteer tested the four mouthwashes. The Cysteine Challenge Method, modified for this study, was used for initial breath standardization. Four breath assessments were conducted after volunteers rinsed orally with acetylcysteine: one before the test mouthwash was used; the second, one minute after its use; a third 90 minutes later; and the last 180 minutes later. The results showed that chlorhexidine gluconate lowered VSC production immediately, and that this effect lasted up to 3 hours, while the tested plants had immediate inhibitory effects but no residual inhibitory effects on VSC. We concluded that Curcuma zedoaria and Camellia sinensis, prepared as infusions and used as mouthwashes, did not have a residual neutralizing effect on VSC.

However, Curcuma zedoaria L, a wild relative of turmeric, is resistant to P. aphanidermatum and has been proposed as a potential donor for rot resistance to C. longa. We used a previously isolated resistance gene candidate Czp11 from C. zedoaria as a template to characterize a major resistance gene CzR1 through candidate gene approach in combination with RACE-PCR strategy. CzR1 encodes a 906 amino acid predicted protein with a calculated pI of 8.55. Structural and phylogenetic analyses grouped CzR1 within the non-TIR (homology to Toll/interleukin-1 receptors) subclass of NBS-LRR R-genes. Reverse transcription PCR revealed specific transcript expression of CzR1 only in P. aphanidermatum resistant lines of C. zedoaria and Zingiber zerumbet, another resistant wild species of the family Zingiberaceae. Semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed constitutive expression of CzR1 which gets significantly upregulated in response to infection by different strains of P. aphanidermatum. Although, the expression of CzR1 was reported in the root, leaf and rhizome tissues of C. zedoaria, the relative transcript expression was highest in the rhizomes. Elucidation of these molecular characteristics of CzR1 will pave way towards a broad spectrum rhizome rot resistance development in the cultivated turmeric. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigated whether and how essential oil of Curcuma zedoaria may induce reproductive and developmental toxicity. Whole embryo culture in rats revealed that the essential oil produced a concentration-dependent toxicity ex vivo in the embryos on gestation Day 9.5 (GD9.5). Weight loss, abnormal hematological and biochemical effects on dams and embryos were also observed in GD17 pregnant rats orally administrated with 100 mg kg(-1) or 200 mg kg(-1) essential oil from GD7 onward. Induction of embryotoxicity may be related to placental calcification attributed to inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that the main toxic compounds in essential oil were sesquiterpenoids. Our results suggest that the reproductive toxicity of C. zedoaria may be caused by sesquiterpenoids in the essential oil blocking VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

They are prepared from chemical reactions that remodel molecular scaffolds directly on extracts of natural resources. This method was applied to terpenes extracted from Curcuma zedoaria. Epoxidation and subsequent ring-opening reactions of epoxides were used to modify molecular skeletons. As a result, seven sesquiterpene-like compounds with some containing new molecular skeletons were obtained.

The essential oils were tested at 1, 3 and 5% (w/v) in the vehicle hydroalcoholic mixture (ethanol: water (1:1 v/v)). The skin permeation of diclofenac sodium was remarkably enhanced in the presence of these three essential oils. Overall, the rank order of the enhancing activities of these oils was Zingiber officinale > Zingiber cassumunar > Curcuma zedoaria. Furthermore, the essential oil at 5% appeared to give the greatest enhancement. For the in vivo skin irritation study, these oils were tested at I and 5% in the vehicle and at 100%. These test solutions including the vehicle were applied to the abdominal surfaces of the Wistar rats and kept in contact with these areas for 24 h. After a biopsy technique, the skin irritation was evaluated under microscopic observation and histological scores were used as an index of skin damage caused by the test compounds. The skin irritation study revealed that the vehicle had no discernible effects in histological appearance in rat skin. The essential oils at concentrations of 1 and 5% in hydroalcoholic mixture and at 100% were found to cause skin irritation in different degrees. The most severe skin damage was observed with the 1% of these oils whereas the 5% of these oils were classified as mild irritants.

Background: Little information is available concerning antioxidant effects of plant teas (water boiled) which are used more commonly in traditional Chinese medicine than other extracts. Thus, we addressed this issue by evaluating the ability of teas from four different plants with therapeutic potential on gynecological diseases. Methods: The aqueous extracts of Semen persicae, Leonurus cardiaca, Hedyotis diffusa, and Curcuma zedoaria rhizome were prepared and then their effects on copper-induced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) oxidation were evaluated by spectrophotometric method. Density gradient ultracentrifugation method was recruited to isolate LDL-C from healthy individuals. Results: Our results showed that adding 10, 20, and 30 mu l S. persicae could increase the lag phase duration of LDL-C oxidation compared with control reaction 12, 21, and 33%, respectively. The most effective delay (87%) was observed when 30 mu l H. diffusa was added to the reaction. In cases of L. cardiaca and C. zedoaria, we found no significant influence on the lag phase duration (p > 0.05). Moreover, our findings about starting point of the decomposition phase were almost in parallel with the lag phase results, as 30 mu l of S. persicae or H. diffusa teas could significantly increase the initiation time of decomposition (p < 0.05). Conclusions: In conclusion our results showed that both S. persicae and H. diffusa teas and not L. cardiaca and C. zedoaria could have medicinal therapeutic effects partly through direct oxidation prevention.

Various species of Curcuma have long been used for several purposes such as healing wounds, liver disorders, jaundice and also as a blood purifier. Aim of the study: This review focused on the ethnophannacological uses and phytochemical aspects of Curcuma. Additionally, in this study, the different properties of two species of Curcuma in Islamic Traditional Medicine (ITM), C. longa and C. zedoaria, as well as their pharmacological aspects in modem medicine are reviewed. Materials and methods: ITM literatures were searched to find Curcuma's applications. Also, electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus were searched to obtain studies giving any in vitro, in vivo or human evidence of the efficacy of C. longa and C. zedoaria in the treatment of different diseases. ChemOffice software was used to find chemical structures. Results: The analysis showed that edam-medical uses of Curcuma have been recorded for centuries. Approximately, 427 chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from Curcuma spp. This genus is rich in flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanin, phenolic compounds, oil, organic acids and inorganic compounds. Curcumin is one of the main active ingredients in Curcuma which has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Besides, pharmacological studies have indicated wide range of Curcuma's activities, such as hepato-protective, antifungal, antihypertensive and neuroprotective. Conclusions: In this study, we reviewed various studies conducted on ethno-medicinal, ITM properties and photochemistry of Curcuma spp. Also, pharmacological activities of two species, C. longa and C. zedoaria are summarized. Pre-clinical investigations have demonstrated some of the traditional aspects of Curcuma, such as wound heating, anti-arthritic, anti-tumor and liver protective activities. These could be related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Curcwna which might be due to high amounts of phenolic compounds. Curcuma is mentioned to have neural tonic properties in ITM which have been confirmed by some animal studies. Considering various precinical studies on C. longa and C zedoaria and their active ingredient, curcumin, randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm their promise as a clinically effective hepato and neuro-protective agents.

Rosc. essential oil and paclitaxel synergistically enhance the apoptosis of SKOV3 cells	MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS			English	Article						Curcuma zedoaria (Berg) Rosc; essential oil; paclitaxel; ovarian cancer; cell apoptosis; cell cycle	CANCER CELLS; OVARIAN-CANCER; IN-VITRO; CARBOPLATIN; CASPASE-3; ANTITUMOR; TAXOL; VIVO	Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Rosc. essential oil (CZEO) is the major component of Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Rosc., a traditional medicine with antitumor activity. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent used to treat patients with ovarian cancer. These compounds directly target nuclear DNA, in order to suppress or inhibit tumor cell growth. The present study aimed to determine the synergistic antitumor effects of CZEO and PTX on the SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cell line. SKOV3 cells were treated with CZEO, PTX or a combination of the two and cell viability was detected using cell counting kit-8. In addition, flow cytometry was used to determined cell apoptosis as well as for cell cycle analysis. The morpho logical changes of apoptosis were assessed using Hoechst 33342 staining and the expression levels of apoptotic pathway proteins, including caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were quantified using western blot analysis. The cell viability assay indicated that either of these compounds alone or in combination suppressed the growth of SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis indicated that treatment with a combination of CZEO and PTX resulted in increased inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of SKOV3 cells, as compared with treatment with either of the compounds alone. In addition, the protein expression levels of caspase-3 were increased following treatment with a combination of CZEO and PTX. The results of the present study suggested that CZEO and PTX synergistically enhanced the inhibition of SKOV3 proliferation, and the possible underlying mechanism may be the induction of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This therefore indicated that PTX supplemented with CZEO may be an effective treatment strategy to decrease the dose and toxicity of PTX.

The qualitative and quantitative analysis of extracts was performed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The effects of pressure, temperature and pow rate of the extracting fluid on the extraction efficiency of SFE were investigated quantitatively. It was found that at a fixed density, changing temperature in a given experimental range had no great influence on the distribution of SFE products, but that an appropriate increase of how rate and fluid volume improves the extraction efficiency. SFE using supercritical carbon dioxide was a more efficient extraction technique than steam distillation.

Rhizome extracts of Curcuma zedoaria Rosc induce caspase dependant apoptosis via generation of reactive oxygen species in filarial parasite Setaria digitata in vitro	EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY			English	Article						Curcuma; Anthelmintic; Setaria nematode; Microfilaria; Parasite; Elephantiasis; Filariasis	GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASES; ANTIFILARIAL ACTIVITY; WUCHERERIA-BANCROFTI; MEDIATED APOPTOSIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; IVERMECTIN; DIETHYLCARBAMAZINE; PHOSPHATASES; EFFICACY; PROTEIN	Human lymphatic filariasis (LF) is mainly caused by filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti and is the second leading cause of long term and permanent disability in tropical countries. To date, incapability to eliminate long lived adult parasites by current drugs remains the major challenge in the elimination of LF. Hence, in the current study, the efficacy of rhizome extracts of Curcuma zedoaria (a plant traditionally used in Sri Lanka in the management of LF) was evaluated as an effective filaricide in vitro. Sequential solvent extracts of C. zedoaria rhizomes were screened for in vitro antifilarial activity at 0.01-1 mg/mL concentrations by motility inhibition assay and 3-(4, 5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay using cattle parasite Setaria digitata as a model organism. Exposure of parasites to hexane and chloroform extracts of C zedoaria caused a dose dependant reduction in motility and viability of microfilariae (IC50 = 72.42 mu g/mL for hexane extract, 191.14 mu g/mL for chloroform extract) and adult parasites (IC50 = 77.07 mu g/mL for hexane extract, 259.87 mu g/mL for chloroform extract). Both extracts were less toxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells when compared to filariae. A dose dependant increase in caspase 3/CED 3 and a decrease in total protein content, cyclooxygenase (COX) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities were observed in adult parasites treated with hexane or chloroform extract. A significant degree of chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation were also observed in these worms by Hoechst 33342 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining respectively. Dose dependant chromosomal DNA laddering was observed in treated adult worms but not in microfilariae in response to both extracts. Oxidative stress parameters such as reduction in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and increase in glutathione s transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities, increased reactive oxygen levels (ROS) and lipid peroxidation were also observed indicating that an apoptotic event is induced by reactive oxygen species.

The results showed that the hydroalcoholic extract, fractions, specially dichloromethane, and a pure compound, denoted as curcumenol (1), exhibited potent and dose-related analgesic activity when evaluated in several models of pain in mice, including writhing, formalin and capsaicin. Compound (1), which seems to be the main active principle from this plant, presented promising analgesic effects, being several times more potent than different reference drugs evaluated in the same experimental models. The calculated ID50 values (mumol/kg, i.p) were 22 and 12 when evaluated in writhing and capsaicin tests, respectively, and 29 mumol/kg in relation to the second phase of the formalin model. The lack of effect in the hot plate test suggests that (1) act by a mechanism which do not involves the participation of the opioid system. The phytochemical analysis indicated that the chemical composition of the plant grown in Brazil is similar to that grown in other countries. The results confirm and justify the popular use of this plant for the treatment of dolorous processes.

Among this group, the beautiful inflorescence and luxurious foliage of C zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe (a traditional source of Zedoary spice, tonic, and perfume) has potential in floriculture. General aspects of plant morphology, growth and flowering of this species, growing under Hawaiian conditions, are reported. Zedoary is a herbaceous and rhizomatous perennial plant composed of an upright pseudostem, a corm (an ovate rhizome), underground cylindrical branches or rhizomes (that develop up to the third order when fully matured), and fleshy roots. Some roots develop terminal storage structures (rounded to elongate tuber-like roots called t-roots). Active axillary buds are on the lower side of the corm and branches. From March to April axillary buds of the corm and apical buds of the third order rhizomes emerge above ground as inflorescences. This basal flower spike will grow about 30 cm tall and appears just before the foliage. On the node closest to the flower spike, a vegetative shoot always develops. No additional floral buds sprout, but more vegetative shoots develop. On corms of recently formed aerial shoots, new branches start to develop. By autumn, the above-ground foliage dies back. From November to December storage roots are formed, having a high ( > 70%) carbohydrate content. Sketches and photos illustrate the branching pattern and morphological plant structures.

Comparison between in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of Curcuma zedoaria from Malaysia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Curcuma zedoaria; antibacterial activity	MICROPROPAGATION; ROSCOE; ASSAY; PLANT	The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Curcuma zedoaria from Malaysia was compared using in vitro and in vivo systems. The comparison was performed against four bacterial strains including two gram negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two gram positive strains (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) using the agar well diffusion method. Petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol were used as solvents for preparing the plant extracts. Growth hormones namely indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) were used in the in vitro system separately between the range of 0.25 and 3.5 mg/l for IBA and 0.5 and 4 mg/l for BAP and a mix formula containing both hormones using the best ranges after rapid tests. The results showed that the in vitro system was more capable of inhibiting S. aureus growth compared with in vivo system on the agar plate. P. aeruginosa and E. coli growth were only inhibited by the in vitro system on the agar plate, while B. cereus was the only strain in the in vivo system which produced higher inhibition zone on the agar plate against its growth compared with the in vitro system.

At harvest, leaves suddenly wilted, curled and yellowed, and the whole plant finally died. The wilted plants had rotted rhizomes with internal discoloration. Creamy-whitish bacteria were isolated from the rhizomes of each Curcuma species. These bacteria were identified as Ralstonia solanacearum race 4, biovar 4 and phylotype I based on bacteriological characteristics, pathogenicity tests and DNA-based analyses. The names bacterial wilt of turmeric, wild turmeric and zedoary are proposed for the diseases.

On this line, the inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthetic enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) have played a role of anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents. In our continuous efforts to search anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive agents from natural products, bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of curdione from the rhizome of Curcuma zedoaria with the inhibitory effect on the production of prostaglandin E-2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1-1 mu M). Mechanistic studies suggest that the suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression is, at least in part, involved in this inhibitory activity of curdione.

Histological analysis revealed that callus was formed from the hypertrophied cortical parenchyma cells of the explant. Some of these cells underwent division while the surrounding cells accumulated starch. Callus was capable of shoot bud regeneration after 70 days when it was transferred to liquid medium of the same composition. After 30 days in liquid medium, buds developed from nodular structures. The adventitious shoots developed extensive root systems when they were placed on agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog medium without growth regulators at 25 degreesC in the light.

SLR analyses showed that the cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds against a given cell line depend on certain descriptors; and the corresponding correlation coefficients (R-2) vary from 0%-55%. MLR results revealed that the best models can be achieved with a limited number of specific descriptors applicable for compounds having a similar basic skeleton. Based on PCA; HCA and MLR analyses; active compounds were classified into subgroups; which was in agreement with the cell based cytotoxicity assay.

The antioxidant studies were carried out by peroxide and thiobarbituric acid values, ferric thiocyanate, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, metal chelating and reducing power methods. Curzerenone (31.6%) was the major component in the volatile oil, followed by germacrone (10.8%). In ethanol, isopropanol and ethyl acetate oleoresin, a total of 26, 25, and 40 components were identified respectively and the major ones are curzerenone, germacrone, camphor and curcumenol. Essential oil, oleoresins (ethyl acetate and isopropanol) showed potent antioxidant activity in all the experiments. However, the activity of ethanol oleoresin was found to be lower as compared to ethyl acetate and isopropanol oleoresin. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We found that the two extracts showed no mutagenicity when tested with all the tester strains either with or without the S9 mix. Moreover, the two extracts, particularly CME, presented a greater antimutagenicity than CAE did either in IQ or 4-NQO mutagens. However, the inhibition effect on lipid peroxidation was similar with both extracts. The amount of major antioxidants beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, and total polyphenols present in both CME and CAE were similar between each other. In contrast, the content of cucuminoids (44.3 mg/g extract) in CME were only found in small amounts in CAE (0.09 mg/g extract). Consequently, although both of the extracts showed similar antioxidant effects, the curcuminoids, which seem to be the main active principles from this plant, were suggested to play a pivotal role in antimutagenic activity.

CZE was identified as a promising anti-inflammatory and photoaging candidate based on a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 promoter assay and the suppressive effects of CZE on UVB-induced cyclooxygenases (COX)-2 and MMP-13 expression were confirmed in immortalized skin human keratinocytes. CZE suppressed UVB-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 3/6/p38, B-Raf/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2, and Akt as well as phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src. Using a chronic skin inflammation and photoaging model, we observed that CZE significantly suppressed repetitive UVB-induced wrinkle formation and COX-2 and MMP-13 expression in vivo. Among the compounds investigated, curcumin was found to exhibit the strongest inhibitory effect on UVB-induced MMP-1 promoter activity. These results demonstrate that CZE has a potent preventive activity for UVB-induced skin inflammation and photoaging, which occurs via the suppression of EGFR, Src, MAPKKs/MAPKs, and Akt phosphorylation. Practical applications This study is a study to develop materials that can prevent skin inflammation and photoaging by UVB exposure. Therefore, it can be applied to functional cosmetics or functional foods after standardization and clinical studies on this material.

The intake of WE-CZ at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg for 6 weeks from 2 weeks before tumor inoculation significantly reduced the number of metastatic surface nodules in the lung, resulting in an extended life span. When the duration of WE-CZ intake was examined, survival time was not affected by pre-intake before B 16 melanoma cell inoculation and was slightly extended by post-intake after B 16 melanoma cell inoculation, although the life span was prolonged by intake throughout the experiment. To address the mechanism underlying the anti-metastatic effect of WE-CZ, we examined the issue of whether WE-CZ modulated macrophage function, which is involved in killing tumor cells. The intake of WE-CZ for 6 weeks increased nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in a dose-dependent manner. The elevated NO was found to serve as a cytotoxic mediator against B 16 melanoma cells in co-culture with macrophages. On the contrary, B16 melanoma-conditioned medium reduced NO production by macrophages. However, WE-CZ treatment significantly reversed the reduction in NO production by the conditioned medium. These findings indicate that WE-CZ possesses anti-migratory effects on B16 melanoma cells and that the macrophage function-modulating activity by WE-CZ appears to underlie its anti-metastatic activity, which leads to a decrease in the number of lung metastatic surface nodules and the extension of life span. These results suggest that WE-CZ may play important roles in the inhibition of cancer metastasis. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This in vitro study evaluated the cytotoxic effects of the Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe (popular name: zedoary) fluid extract, as used in preparations for oral hygiene, mostly for anti-septic purposes. Materials and methods. The cell viability and cell growth were assessed by Trypan blue dye exclusion assay using the LMF cell line derived from oral mucosa. Cell viability (short-term assay) was measured 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after contact with the fluid extract. Cell growth (long-term assay) was analyzed in 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. The experimental groups were those testing the fluid extract obtained from the zedoary rhizome and the extractor liquid (ethanol 70 degrees GL) in the concentrations of 0.01-0.0001% v/v. Fresh DMEM were used in the control cultures. Results. Short-term assay-all studied cultures maintained stable cell viability; Long-term assay-there was progressive cell growth in all studied cultures. Conclusion. According to the results, the zedoary fluid extract presents low cytotoxicity and probably can be used in the oral hygiene products.

To clarify the active compounds, the principal constituents were examined and 11 sesquiterpenes (furanodiene, curdione, neocurdrione, dehydrocurdione, germacrone, 13-hydroxygermacrone, curcumenol, isocurcumenol, aerugidiol, zedoarondiol, and curcumenone) and a diarylheptanoid (curcumin) were found to inhibit the increase in serum aspartate amino-transaminase and alanine aminotransaminase at a dose of 50 mg/kg p.o. in agreement with the previous in vitro studies, except for dehydrocurdione, aerugidiol, and zedoarondiol. In particular, curdione, neocurdione, curcumenol, and isocurcumenol potently inhibited the increase at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg p.o. Furthermore, the eight sesquiterpenes, furanodiene, curdione, neocurdione, dehydrocurdione, germacrone, 13-hydroxygermacrone, curcumenol, and curcumenone, also showed a protective effect against D-GalN/tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced liver injury in mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg p.o.

Roscoe - a conservation prioritised medicinal plant in Bangladesh	CONSERVATION GENETICS			English	Article						Curcuma zedoaria; ecological distribution; genetic diversity; RAPD	ZINGIBERACEAE	Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe, a member of the family Zingiberaceae, is one of the most widely distributed Curcuma species in Bangladesh. It is a well-known and important species because of its medicinal and horticultural values. However, some plant populations are predicted to be depleted due to habitat destruction and due to extensive collection by local inhabitants. In order to estimate the level of genetic diversity within and between natural populations, RAPD analyses were performed using individual plants from different populations. We used Shannon's index to partition genetic diversity which clearly demonstrated that hilly populations of Srimangal, Chittagong and Sitakundu maintain rather higher genetic diversity than that of plain land and plateau land populations of Savar and Birganj, respectively. We found a high intrapopulational (H'(pop)/H'(sp)) genetic diversity of 0.717 that was higher than the interpopulation diversity G (ST)[(H'(sp)-H'(pop))/H'(sp)] value of 0.283. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) showed that individuals of the hilly populations were combined in one group, separated from the plain land and plateau land populations. From a conservation point of view, our results suggest that special attention should be kept on the small populations of plain and plateau lands that are critically threatened due to high anthropogenic activities.

The maximum cell biomass of 68.46 g/L fresh weight was obtained after 14 days of culture in a 10 L bioreactor with a pitch-blade impeller maintained at an agitation speed of 150 rpm and an aeration rate of 2.5 L/min. The accumulation of sesquiterpenes and polysaccharide in zedoary cells from 2 to 18 days was measured by HPLC and a phenol-sulfuric acid assay, respectively. The total polysaccharide concentration increased between 2 to 10 days of culture and reached a maximum value of 6.55%. HPLC revealed several eluted peaks of sesquiterpenes, which increased in amplitude from days 2 to 10. Furthermore, our results indicated that biotransformation occurred in the cell suspension, transforming certain sesquiterpenes into other types during culture.

In this paper, the characteristics of introduction of free fatty acids (FFAs) into Gajutsu (Curcuma zedoaria), Teppo-yuri (Lilium longiflorum) and potato starches, being very low in the above ''embraced lipids'' contents (9.2-25.6mg%), were investigated. It was found that the saturated FFAs were more abundantly introduced into them (41.2-174.7 mg%) than the unsaturated ones (15.9-46.5 mg%), and the respective starches differed from one another in capacity of introducing each FFA. There was also found some characteristic changes in pasting feature after introduction of FFAs depending upon the respective starches. Furthermore, their Nageli-amylodextrins were prepared as a model of their crystalline portion and were subjected to introduction of FFAs. On these results, a possible distributing diagram of the introduced FFAs in a granule of the respective starch was proposed.

The current study was to investigate health-benefits of the rhizomes of endemic Curcuma caesia, Curcuma zedoaria and Curcuma aeruginosa using in vitro antioxidant, antiinflammatory and human tumor cell proliferation inhibitory activities. Among these, C. caesia (black turmeric) showed the best overall biological activities based on [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO), cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and -2) enzymes, and tumor cell growth inhibitory assays. The hexane and methanolic extracts of C. caesia (CCH and CCM) showed LPO inhibition by 31 and 43 %, and COX-2 enzyme by 29 and 38 %, respectively, at 100 mu g/ml. Eleven terpenoids were isolated and identified. The MTT antioxidant assay revealed that the extracts of three Curcuma spp. at 250 mu g/ml and isolates at 5 mu g/ml demonstrated activity comparable to positive controls vitamin C and t-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) at 25 mu g/ml. The extracts inhibited LPO by 40 % at 250 mu g/ml whereas pure isolates 1-11 by about 20 %. The extracts and isolates inhibited COX-1 and -2 enzymes between the ranges of 3-56 and 5-30 %, respectively. The in vitro biological activity exhibited by the extracts and isolates of C. caesia rhizome further supported its use in traditional medicine.	[Liu, Yunbao; Roy, Subhra Saikat; Nebie, Roger H.

To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of a traditional herbal medicine, Zedoariae rhizoma water extracts (ZR) was examined on the growth inhibition of human hMF since proliferation of hMF is known to be central for the development of fibrosis during liver injury, and factors that may limit their growth are potential antifibrotic agents. The aim of this study was to test the effects of ZR on the proliferation and to clarify the molecular mechanisms of ZR inhibition of HSC proliferation in cultured human hMF. The cells were stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB in the presence or absence of ZR. Proliferation was determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. The mRNA expressions of collagen alpha1(I) and (IV) were evaluated by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PDGF-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. PDGF-receptor radioligand binding assay was performed by [125 I]PDGF-BB. ZR inhibited the PDGF-BB-induced cell-proliferation and collagen alpha1(I) and (IV) mRNA expressions. ZR reduced the autophospborylation of the PDGF-receptor. ZR blocked PDGF-BB binding to its receptor in a non-competitive manner. Furthermore, the 80% aqueous acetone extract of ZR was also found to show a decreasing effect against the proportion of S phase cells after PDGF stimulation. To clarify the active compounds, the principal constituents of seven sesquiterpenes (curdione, dehydrocurdione, germacrone, curcumenol, isocurcumenol, zedoarondiol and curcumenone) and a diarylheptanoid (curcumin) were examined. Among them, curcumin was found to decrease the proportion of S phase cells after PDGF stimulation at a dose of 30-50 muM. Potent antiproliferative and antifibrogenic effects of ZR toward hMF indicated that ZR might have therapeutic implications in chronic liver disease, indicating a novel role for ZR as a growth inhibitory mediator and pointing out its potential involvement in the negative regulation of liver fibrogenesis. In conclusion, ZR has an inhibitory effect on PDGF-induced proliferation of hMF and the blocking of PDGF-BB binding to its receptor may be the mechanism behind this effect. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The simple way to stop the transmission is to control the vector by using synthetic chemicals. However, herbal essential oils have biological properties, such as a larvicidal effect and are ecofriendly to use. In this study, we investigated the larvicidal activity of Curcuma zedoaria essential oil (ZEO) and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using this essential oil (ZEO-AgNPs). The larvicidal activity against both insecticide-susceptible and -resistant strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae of ZEO were investigated and compared with ZEO-AgNPs. The ZEO-AgNPs showed the utmost toxicity against both strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus. After 24 h of exposure, LC50 and LC99 of ZEO against susceptible strain were 36.32 and 85.11 ppm, respectively. While LC50 and LC99 of ZEO against the resistant strain were 37.29 and 76.79 ppm, respectively. Whereas ZEO-AgNPs offered complete larval mortality within 24 h of exposure, LC50 and LC99 of ZEO-AgNPs against the susceptible strain, were 0.57 and 8.54 ppm, respectively. For the resistant strain, LC50 and LC99 values were 0.64 and 8.88 ppm, respectively. The potency in killing Cx. quinquefasciatus and stability of ZEO-AgNPs have made this product a good candidate for the development of novel natural larvicides.

The highest cell biomass obtained from a 5-l bioreactor equipped with three impellers after 14 days of culture was utilized to extract secondary metabolites (essential oil and curcumin) and determine the activities of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase). For essential oil and curcumin, zedoary extracts were recovered via a variety of methods: steam distillation, volatile solvents, and Soxhlet. After 14 days of culture using volatile solvents, the optimal yield of essential oil (1.78%) was obtained when using petroleum ether at 40 degrees C in 6 h of extraction, and the best curcumin yield (9.69%) was obtained at 60 degrees C in 6 h via extraction with 90% ethanol. The activities of antioxidant enzymes from zedoary cells were also assessed. The specific activities of peroxidase, superoxide-dismutase, and catalase reached maximum values of 0.63 U/mg of protein, 16.60 U/mg of protein, and 19.59 U/mg of protein after 14 days of culture, respectively.

Therefore, elimination of collagen deposition has becoming a potential target in PF treatment which despite standard anti-fibrosis regiment still remains challenge. Curcumin and curcumol are regarded as the main active components extraction from the rhizomes of Curcuma zedoaria, which is widely used for inhibition the proliferation of multiple cells. However, the molecular basis for the function of curcumin and curcumol in limiting fibrogenesis still unknown. In this study, we have investigated the effects of curcumin and curcumol in the fibroblast overproliferation model human lung fibroblast (HLF) inducing by TGF-beta 1. The growth-inhibitory effects of the components wasn't observed from 8 to 64 mu g/ml. Administration of curcumin or curcumol significantly diminished the level of hydroxyproline hydroxyproline and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), also the collagen. (Col-I) and collagen. (Col-II) deposition were reduced in the HLF. Furthermore, related to the collagen synthesis proteins including N-terminal pro-peptide for Type. collagen (PINP), N-terminal pro-peptide for Type III collagen (PIIINP) and prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) were degraded gracefully at dose-dependent manner. Autophagy as the scavenger was crippled in TGF-beta 1-fibroblast overproliferation HLF, conversely the increased autophagosomes have been spotted in cytoplasm under transmission electron microscope which is consistent with up-regulation of Beclin1 and ATG7 after treatment with curcumin or curcumol in this study. Additionally, blocking autophagy by inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) caused collagen deposition, providing further evidence regard to autophagy activation capacity of curcumin and curcumol. Our findings provide a detailed understanding that the function of curcumin and curcumol on decreasing collagen deposition mediating by autophagy mechanism, which may also inspire the further research on PF at different perspectives.

An in vivo diabetic wound healing study showed that separate or combined treatments all resulted in a wound contraction in diabetic rats, as evidenced by a decrease of ulcer and an increase of epidermal thickness, but PRP-Exos/ZWP combination therapy was more successful in wound closing than either PRP-Exos or ZWP single administration. This could be due to the upregulation of collagen synthesis and deposition, as well as angiogenesis at the wound site. In addition to this, no side effects was observed in all treated groups during healing process. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for PRP-Exos/ZWP as a potential therapeutic strategy to accelerate skin repair in diabetes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Docetaxel is the common chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of TNBC. However, resistance to docetaxel has limited the effectiveness of TNBC treatment. Petroleum ether extracts of Curcuma zedoaria (PECZ) can inhibit the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the effect of PECZ on docetaxel resistance is not clear. Methods: A docetaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231/docetaxel) cell line was established, and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting assays were used to evaluate the effect of docetaxel resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. Next, CCK-8 was also performed to detect the effect of docetaxel or the combination treatment of docetaxel and PECZ on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231/docetaxel cells. Thereafter, MDA-MB-231/docetaxel cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to induce a TNBC xenograft model, and the mice were divided into a model group, docetaxel group, PECZ group, and combination of docetaxel and PECZ group. Subsequently, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemical, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were used to estimate the effect of pre-treatment with PECZ on docetaxel tolerance reversal. Results: PECZ significantly inhibited the expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR), multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and cytochrome P-450 (CYP3A4) in MDA-MB-231/ docetaxel cells. Only higher concentrations of docetaxel could inhibit the viability of MDA-MB-231/ docetaxel cells. When pre-treated with PECZ, lower concentrations of docetaxel could significantly inhibit cell viability. Meanwhile, combination treatment also reduced the tumor volume, ameliorated the pathological change of tumor tissues, and down-regulated the expressions of PXR, MDR1, BCRP, and CYP3A4 (according to HE staining, immunohistochemical, qRT-PCR and western blotting results in vivo). Conclusions: Our research showed that PECZ reversed docetaxel resistance in TNBC by PXR both in vitro and in vivo, which provides the basis for further investigations into the potential therapeutic impact of docetaxel resistance in TNBC.

Sequence characterized amplified region markers: A reliable tool for adulterant detection in turmeric powder	FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Adulterants; Curcuma longa; Curcuma zedoaria; Curcuma malabarica; RAPD; SCAR; Turmeric powder	SCAR MARKERS; TRNK GENE; IDENTIFICATION; QUALITY	Turmeric powder (Curcuma longa L), an important medicinal spice product traded internationally, is subjected to adulteration by design or default with powders of related curcumin containing wild species like Curcuma zedoaria and Curcuma malabarica leading to toxicity and poor quality of the produce. The present study aims at development of specific, sensitive and reproducible Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) markers to detect these adulterants in traded turmeric powder. Two putative RAPD markers, 'Cur 01' and 'Cur 02', generated by random primers OPA 01 and OPE 18 were identified as C. zedoaria/C. malabarica specific by comparative RAPD analysis of genuine turmeric and market samples of turmeric powder, C. zedoaria and C. malabarica. These specific RAPD markers were cloned and sequenced. Two pairs of SCAR primers were designed from the RAPD markers 'Cur 01' and 'Cur 02', respectively. Six market samples of turmeric powder and four simulated standards besides the genuine samples were analyzed using the specific SCAR markers. Both the SCAR markers detected the presence of C. zedoaria/C. malabarica adulteration in four market samples and all the simulated standards prepared in different concentrations. The two SCAR markers developed in the study would be potentially useful for the regulatory agencies to detect C. zedoaria/C. malabarica adulteration in traded turmeric powder. The analytical strategy being very simple could be used for large scale screening of turmeric powder samples intended for export and domestic uses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rosc. are gaining increasing interest worldwide due to its medicinal and cosmetic application, however, the chemical constituents of their essential oil are not well explored. Therefore, the present research aims to obtain a deeper understanding of the volatile composition of two important Curcuma species viz. C. angustifolia and C. zedoaria using two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS). A total of 206 different compounds were detected (139 in C. angustifolia and 147 in C. zedoaria), including alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, ketones, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, phenylpropanoids, furans, and fatty acids. The major compounds were epicurzerenone (29.62 %), curzerenone (10.79 %), and trans-beta-terpineol (6.12 %) in C. angustifolia and curzerenone (17.72 %), gamma-Eudesmol acetate (15.85 %), and germacrone (6.50 %) in the C. zedoaria rhizome essential oil. Two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry tentatively identified about three times more constituents than those identified by one dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). The result showed the superiority of GC x GC-TOFMS to detect a higher no. of trace constituents and separate co-eluting components that remain unresolved on a single GC column. Both the essential oil exhibited promising antioxidant activity and were comparable to that of positive standard ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The essential oil of both the Curcuma species exhibited good antimicrobial activity against five bacterial, three fungal and yeast strains; however, C. zedoaria essential oil displayed a strong inhibitory effect against Candida albicans (6.25 mu g/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.25 mu g/mL). The present study provides significant information on the chemical profile and bioactivity studies of rhizome essential oil of Curcuma angustifolia and Curcuma zedoaria.

However, there is confusion about the drug's botanical origins and clinical uses because of morphological similarity of Curcuma plants and drugs. In order to develop an ultimate identification, molecular analysis based on 18S rRNA gene and trnK gene sequences were performed on 6 Curcuma species used medicinally in China and Japan. The 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to be of 1810 bps in length. In comparison with the common sequence of C. longa, C. phaeocaulis, C. wenyujin and C. aromatica, that of C kwangsiensis had one base substitution, and the same base difference was observed between the Chinese and the Japanese populations of C. zedoaria. The trnK gene sequences were found to span 2698-2705 bps. There were base substitutions, small deletions or insertions at some sites between the trnK coding region and matK region among each species. Based on the base substitutions, C zedoaria and C. kwangsiensis specimens were divided into two groups, respectively. An identical sequence was detected in C phaeocaulis and in the Chinese population of C. zedoaria, as well as in the Japanese population of C. zedoaria and in one group of C. kwangsiensis with a purple-colored band in leaves. New taxonomic information to be used for authenticating Curcuma drugs was obtained.

The current study aim is to investigate the modulatory effects of curcumenol towards the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation in BV-2 microglia. Curcumenol markedly decreased LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO), pro-inflammatory cytokines [(IL-6) and (TNF-alpha)] and pro-inflammatory proteins expression, iNOS and COX-2. Moreover, curcumenol inhibited NF-kappa B activation by suppressing the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa B p65 subunit and blocking I kappa B alpha phosphorylation and degradation. Furthermore, an NF-kappa B inhibitor, ethyl 3,4-dihydroxycinnamate also known as caffeic acid ethyl ester (CAEE), attenuated LPS-stimulated iNOS and COX-2 expression, suggesting that NF-kappa B inhibition is a regulator in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins. Further mechanistic study with an Akt inhibitor, triciribine hydrate (API-2), revealed that curcumenol acted through Akt-dependent NF-kappa B activation. Moreover, curcumenol inhibition on LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is confirmed by its inhibitor (SB 202190). These results indicate that curcumenol diminishes the proinflammatory mediators and the expression of the regulatory genes in LPS-stimulated BV-2 by inhibiting Akt-dependent NF-kappa B activation and downregulation of Akt and p38 MAPKs signaling.

This research aimed to determine the antibacterial activity of nanoparticles of Curcuma longa, Curcuma zedoaria, and Allium sativum extract to CRD infected chicken. In vivo test of antibacterial activity of turmeric, zedoary, and garlic nanoparticle in combination was conducted on chicken infected by M. gallisepticum and Escherichia coli (E.coli). Antibiotic control used was enrofloxacin. As many as 75 chickens were divided into 5 groups containing 15 chickens each. Group one consisted of healthy chickens (positive control); group two consisted of chickens that have been inoculated by bacteria (negative control); group three (treatment) were chickens inoculated by bacterium and given extract nanoparticle combination on day 7 of infection for 7 days; group four (prevention) were chickens inoculated by bacterium and given combination of extract nanoparticles on day 5 before infection for 14 days; group five were chickens inoculated with bacterium and given enrofloxacin antibiotics for 7 days. In vivo research results showed increased body weight and performance indicated by improvements in clinical signs, and gross pathology changes. The combination of three extract nanoparticles showed the best activity in controlling CRD in chicken, both as preventive and curative means.

Methods: Phytochemical screening was done to find the presence of various secondary metabolites of the plant. In vivo antinociceptive activity was performed employing the hot plate method, acidic acid induced writhing test and formalin induced writhing test on Swiss albino mice at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight. Anti-inflammatory activity test was done on Long Evans rats at two different doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) by using carrageenan induced paw edema test. Finally in vitro anti-inflammatory test by protein-denaturation method was followed. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's t-test was used as the test of significance. P value < 0.05 was considered as the minimum level of significance. Results: Phytochemical screening revealed presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, gums & carbohydrates, steroids, alkaloids, reducing sugars and terpenoids in the extract. In the hot plate method, the extract increased the reaction time of heat sensation significantly to 61.99% and 78.22% at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg BW respectively. In acetic acid induced writhing test, the percent inhibition of writhing response by the extract was 48.28% and 54.02% at 250 and 500 mg/kg doses respectively (p < 0.001). The extract also significantly inhibited the licking response in both the early phase (64.49%, p < 0.01) and the late phase (62.37%, p < 0.01) in formalin induced writhing test. The extract significantly (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001) inhibited carrageenan induced inflammatory response in rats in a dose related manner. In in-vitro anti-inflammatory test, the extract significantly inhibited protein denaturation of 77.15, 64.43, 53.04, 36.78 and 23.70% for doses of 500, 400, 300, 200 and 100 mu g/mL respectively. Conclusions: The results obtained from the tests indicate that the plant might have one or more secondary metabolite(s) having central and peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.

Zedoary essential oil increased the sub-G1 population and the level of annexin-V binding and induced cleavage and activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase. Decreases in the levels of Bc1-2 and Bc1-xL and an increase in the Bax/Bc1-2 ratio were also observed following zedoary essential oil treatment. Notably, zedoary essential oil led to the release of AIF, endonuclease G, and cytochrome c into the cytosol and increased levels of p53 in H1299 cells. Our results indicate that zedoary essential oil slightly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38. Zedoary essential oil also inhibited AKT/NF-kappa B signaling pathways in H1299 cells. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of zedoary essential oil significantly suppressed the growth of H1299 cells in vivo. In addition, potential active compounds were detected using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. 8,9-Dehydro-9-formyl-cycloisolongifolene, 6-etheny1-4,S,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-5-isopropenyl-trans-benzofuran, eucalyptol, and gamma-elemene were found in zedoary essential oil. In summary, our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying zedoary essential oil-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells that are worthy of further study.

The modern healthcare to reduce the dysfunction of metabolic syndrome is burdened with great problems of unsafe medicines and certain degree of side effects. Medicinal plants and derived component products are becoming increasingly popular in modern society as natural alternatives to synthetic multiple drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The present research work was carried out to evaluate the zedoary (Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe.) herbal tea (ZHT) for antihypercholestrolemic and antilipidemic perspectives in discerning consumers. Methods: Zedoary rhizome dried powder (ZRDP) after proximate composition analysis was used to prepared ZHT samples as T-1 (500 mg ZRDP), T-2 (1 g ZRDP) and T-3 (1.5 g ZRDP) in 200 mL boiling water for 5 minutes, respectively. ZHT samples were characterized for total phenolic compounds (TPC), DPPH inhibition, total flavonoids, color tonality (L*, a* and b* value), pH, acidity, total soluble solids (TSS) and sensory acceptance. Thirty mildhypercholestrolemic male human volunteers were randomly allocated to three groups (G(1), G(2) and G(3)) and each group consisting of 1o mild-hypercholestrolemic male human subjects. The volunteers were assigned ZHT samples for consecutive two months. The blood drawn for day 0, day 30 and day 60 after an overnight 12 h fast was analyzed for serum parameters such as total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) and triglycerides (TG) concentration. Results: The ZRDP possessed abundantly the crude protein (13.5 +/- 0.68 %), total dietary fiber (21.86 +/- 0.71 %), acid detergent fiber (13.22 +/- 0.44 %), neutral detergent fiber (18.68 +/- 0.53 %) and mineral contents. Highest TPC, DPPH inhibition and total flavonoids values were observed 9.74 +/- 0.64 (mg GAE/g DW), 47.28 +/- 1.62 (%) and 17.12 +/- 0.75 (QE mg/g), respectively in T-3. L* value was significantly (p <= 0.05) low for T-3 samples. In contrast, a* value and b* value was significantly (p <= 0.05) higher for T-3 when compared with T-1 and T-2. T-3 samples showed lower pH (5.13 +/- 0.13) and higher acidity (0.25 +/- 0.08) values than T-1 (5.64 +/- 0.25, 0.17 +/- 0.05) and T-2 (5.42 +/- 0.21, 0.21 +/- 0.06), respectively. Similarly, an increasing trend in TSS contents was observed. Sensory scores assigned to color, flavor, aroma and overall acceptability attributes varied in a quite narrow range for all ZHT samples. The lowest evaluation scores were recorded for T-3 samples. The G(3) showed the more reduction in body weight and BMI during efficacy study as compared to G(1) and G(2). The decrease in serum TC for G(1), G(2) and G(3) on day 60 was observed 9 %, 14 % and 17 %, respectively when compared with reference value at day 0. The consumption of T-3 resulted in significant increase (6.8 %) of HDL-cholesterol after two months. A trend in decrease of serum LDL-cholesterol (5.6 %) and TG (12.5 %) was also observed after consumption of T-3 at day 60. Conclusions: The results of the present study conclude that the strong phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity of zedoary rhizome have protective role against hypercholesterolemic and lipidemic conditions.

Curcumin is the most wellstudied bioactive component isolated from rhizomes of C. longa and other Curcuma species except C. zedoaria. In this study, we investigated the affects of C. longa, C zedoaria from Japan and curcumin on CYP A4. Caco-2 cells, in which CYP3A4 expression was induced by 1 alpha,25-(OH)(2)-D-3, were used to mimic the metabolism of small intestine. Caco-2 cells were treated with methanol extracts from two Curcuma rhizomes (0.1 mg/md) or curcumin (30 mu M) for 72 h. Both extracts significantly decreased the activity of CYP3A4 by about 85-98%. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of C. longa and C. zedoaria extracts were 0.019 and 0.014 mg/ml, respectively. They caused a 60-70% decrease in CYP3A4 protein. Otherwise, curcumin treatment caused a 30-40% decrease in CYP3A4 catalytic activity and a 38% decrease in CYP3A4 protein expression. Moreover, it was found that both Curcuma extracts and curcumin treatment had no influence on CYP3A4 mRNA expression. Our results suggested that administration of Curcuma drugs might inhibit the catalytic activity of intestinal CYP3A4. However, curcumin was not the major compound responsible for this inhibitory effect. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of C. longa, which induces only endothelium-independent vasodilatation, and C. zedoaria, which induces both endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation, were studied on vasomotion and hemorheology in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive eight-week-old male rats were assigned to five groups. For 12 weeks, the control group received standard chow. The 3%CL (C. longa) group received standard chow containing 3% (wt/wt) C. longa. The 1%CZ and 3%CZ (C. zedoaria) groups received standard chow containing 1% and 3% (wt/wt) C. zedoaria, respectively. The captoril group received standard chow and 100 mg/kg/day of captoril in drinking water. Blood pressure, vasomotion, hemorheology, etc, were examined. Systolic blood pressure of the 3%CZ and captoril groups decreased significantly as compared to the control group. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations of the 3%CZ and captoril groups were increased to a greater degree, significantly, than the control group. When testing xanthine oxidase-induced contraction, the 3%CZ group was significantly decreased as compared to the control group. Low shear stress of whole blood viscosity showed the 3%CL and 3%CZ groups to be decreased significantly compared to the control group. Thus, Curcuma herbs have hypotensive and protective effect on the endothelium in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Especially, C. zedoaria is more effective than C. longa, and its mechanism is thought to be related to a radical scavenging effect and improvement of hemorheology.

This was immobilised on poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) microspheres for effective delivery. The presence of curcuminoids in C. zedoaria extract was confirmed by GC-MS and LC-MS analyses. The ZnO/C. zedoaria. nanocomposite synthesised in this study was subjected to X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, which revealed the crystalline nature of formed nanocomposite. The nanocomposite was then immobilised on PCL microspheres by emulsion solvent evaporation. Further, XRD and FE-SEM confirmed the presence of nanocomposites and the spherical nature of the polymeric microspheres with diameter ranging from 4 to 36 mu m. The antimicrobial activity analysis revealed the remarkable effectiveness of the nanocomposite loaded microspheres. The ethnonanocomposite loaded PCL microspheres generated in the study can thus be an effective antimicrobial agent with diverse biomedical applications.

Curcuma zedoaria and Curcuma malabarica were studied. The starch from C malabarica tubers was white in color, while that from C. zedoaria was slightly yellowish due to the presence of the yellow pigment, curcumin. The granule size and shape, amylose content and solubility did not show noticeable difference between starches from the two species. Both the starches possess "B" type x-ray diffraction pattern. Curcuma zedoaria starch showed a lower peak viscosity and swelling volume when compared to C. malabarica starch. The complete removal of curcumin from C zedoaria starch by alcohol extraction, resulted in an increase in the swelling and viscosity values close to those of C malabarica starch. The breakdown in viscosity was quite low for both the starches and setback was higher when compared to cassava and sweet potato starches. The experiments showed that Curcuma starch resembles Dioscorea starches in most of its properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data showed that the onset of gelatinisation was earlier for C. malabarica starch. The enthalpy of gelatinization was almost same for both the starches. The phosphorus content of Curcuma starch was quite high and similar to that of Potato starch. The Curcuma starch was found to be easily digestible like arrowroot starch as seen from the in vitro alpha-amylase digestibility patterns. Owing to the high viscosity stability and digestibility, it can be a potential source of starch for food and industry.

SIEB; TGF-BETA; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS; FIBROIDS; CANCER	Crude water extracts of 13 traditional Korean medicinal ingredients used for leiomyomal treatment were prepared and used to treat human uterine normal myometrial and leiomyomal cell cultures. All the ingredients inhibited proliferation and altered the morphology of both myometrial and leiomyomal cells. Among the 13 ingredients, n-hexane-, chloroform-, and ethylacetate-soluble fractions were extracted from seven ingredients that potently inhibited cell proliferation in their water extract form. Among these, the ethylacetate-fraction of Phlomis umbrosa and Spatholobus suberectus, and the chloroform-fraction of Curcuma zedoaria and S. suberectus inhibited leiomyomal cell proliferation significantly compared to myometrial cell proliferation. Similarly, immunohistochemical analysis showed the inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2 in leiomyomal tissue after treatment with the fractions of the ingredients. Moreover, the chloroform-fraction of C. zedoaria was subfractionated by open column chromatography. Two of the eight subfractions (fractions 6 and 7) potently inhibited cell proliferation in leiomyoma compared to myometrium. Further study will be performed with the goal of isolating specific compounds from two effective subfractions of C. zedoaria, ethylacetate-fraction of P. umbrosa, and the ethylacetate and chloroform-fractions of S. suberectus. The present study may be helpful in developing an alternative remedy to leiomyoma with minimal side-effects compared to the current treatments.

The biological activities of Curcuma have been attributed to the non-volatile curcuminoids as well as to volatile terpenoids. Curcuma essential oils have demonstrated a wide variety of pharmacological properties. The objective of this work was to examine the variation in the compositions of Curcuma rhizome essential oils. In this work, the volatile oils from C. longa and C. zedoaria were obtained and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chemical compositions of C. longa and C. zedoaria essential oils, including those reported in the literature, were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis. In addition, cluster analyses of the chemical compositions of C. aromatica and C. aeruginosa from the literature were also carried out. Curcuma longa volatiles were dominated by alpha-turmerone, curlone, ar-turmerone, beta-sesquiphellandrene, alpha-zingiberene, germacrone, terpinolene, ar-curcumene, and alpha-phellandrene and showed four distinct chemical clusters. C. zedoaria rhizome oil contained 1,8-cineole, curzerenone/epi-curzerenone, alpha-copaene, camphor, beta-caryophyllene, elemol, germacrone, curzerene, and beta-elemene and showed two different chemical types. C. aromatica had three clearly defined clusters, and C. aeruginosa had three types.

We inoculated Ichthyophonus sp. on agar plates where we placed the filter discs that were prepared by filtering the aqueous extracts (five concentrations) of ginger (Zingiber officinale), linseed (Linum usitatissimum), henna (Lawsonia inermis) and white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria). All plants inhibited the growth of Ichthyophonus sp. in the highest concentration (20%); Z. officinale appeared to be the most effective, whereas C. zedoaria was the least effective. This study suggests that widely available and inexpensive plant extracts might be effective natural agents to prevent the Ichthyophonus sp. infection in fish. More research is needed in order to ascertain the efficiency of the plant extracts in vivo as well as to find a proper practice used in aquaculture.

The present study designed some novel germacrone derivatives based on combination principles, synthesized these compounds, and investigated their inhibitions on Bel-7402, HepG2, A549 and HeLa cells. Meanwhile, the study evaluated inhibitions of these derivatives on c-Met kinase, which has been detected in a number of cancers. The results suggested that the majority of the compounds showed stronger inhibitory effect on cancers and c-Met kinase than germacrone. Furthermore, our docking experiments analyzed the results and explained the molecular mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations were then applied to perform further evaluation of the binding stabilities between compounds and their receptors.

AGAINST FUSARIUM SOLANI SENSU LATO	PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY JOURNAL			English	Article						Turmeric species/strains; curcuminoids; antifungal activity; Fusarium spp	XANTHORRHIZA ROXB.; LONGA L.; CURCUMINOIDS; RHIZOMES; EXTRACT; FUNGI	Turmeric (Curcuma spp.) are rhizomatous perennial herbs with broad spectrum of pharmacological actions. There are more than 80 species of turmeric and 70 varieties/strains of Curcuma longa, which may have different chemical properties and biological activities. Hence, we compared the major active components (curcuminoides) and antifungal activity of three Curcuma longa strains (Ryudai gold (RD), Okinawa ukon, and BK2), C. xanthorrhiza, C. aromatica, C. amada, and C. zedoaria against Fusarium solani sensu lato (FSSL). The content of curcuminoides was determined by HPLC and the antifungal activity was measured by the diameter of colonies grown on Petri dish, microscopic observation, and CLSI microdilution methods. The BK2 turmeric contained highest concentration of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin followed by RD, C. xanthorrhiza, Okinawa ukon, and C. aromatica. These compounds were not detected in C. amada and C. zedoaria. All turmeric species inhibited fungal growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of IC50 against FSSL was RD (78 to 92 mu g/ml) > BK2 (89 to 101 mu g/ml) > C. xanthorrhiza (98 to 114 mu g/ml) > C. aromatica (183 to 204 mu g/ml) > C. amada (183 to 206 mu g/ml) > Okinawa ukon (191 to 216 mu g/ml) > C. zedoaria (354 to 385 mu g/ml). The results showed a correlation between the antifungal activity and curcuminiods contents of turmeric. Curcumin itself showed marked antifungal activity against FSSL (IC50 = 23 to 25 mu g/ml) followed by demethoxycurcumin (IC50 = 25 to 27 mu g/ml), while the antifungal activity of bisdemethoxycurcumin was extremely low (IC50 = 216 to 238 mu g/ml). However, C. amada and C. zedoaria had no curcuminoids but showed antifungal effects which indicated that other compounds could also inhibit the growth of FSSL. The obtained results demonstrated that turmeric species C. longa (strains Ryudai gold and BK2) and C. xanthorrhiza had higher content of curcuminoids and showed excellent antifungal activity against FSSL.

In the present study, novel germacrone derivatives were first designed based on the theories of bioalkylating agents, synthesized, and then investigated for their inhibition effects on Bel-7402, HepG2, A549, and HeLa cells. Moreover, the study also evaluated the inhibition of these derivatives on c-Met kinase, which is expressed in a number of cancers. The results indicated that most of the compounds showed a stronger inhibitory effect on cancer cells and c-Met kinase than germacrone. Besides these findings, molecular docking studies were also carried out to analyze the results and explain the molecular mechanism of activities to c-Met kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for the further evaluation of binding stabilities between the compounds and their receptors.

Since nitric oxide (NO) is the relaxation factor of vascular smooth muscle and also an inhibitor of platelet aggregation in blood vessels, substances showing NO-dependent relaxation are thought to be effective in improving Oketsu. In this study, five Curcuma drugs derived from Curcuma longa, C kwangsiensis, C phaeocaulis, C wenyujin, and C zedoaria were used. Methanol extracts exhibited intense effects on relaxation in rings precontracted by prostaglandin F-2alpha (PGF(2alpha)) despite pretreatment with and without N-G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) as an inhibitor of NO synthesis. The maximal activities were approximately 80% at 10(-3) g/ml. From these methanol extracts, curcumin and eight sesquiterpenes were isolated. Since all these compounds showed NO-independent relaxation effects with almost the same intensities, the relaxation effects of Curcuma drugs can be estimated by the total amounts of curcumin and sesquiterpenes. Polysaccharides, the main constituents of methanol-insoluble compounds of water extracts, in contrast, showed contraction effects; only polysaccharides in C zedoaria showed NO-dependent relaxation as well as contraction. All water extracts showed relaxation effects as sum of the methanol-soluble compounds-induced relaxation and polysaccharides-induced contraction. Therefore, all Curcuma drugs tested in the present study can be effective for vasodilation. Moreover, the drug derived from C zedoaria has potential to cure Oketsu with its various acting points.

Roscoe; their major compounds (camphene, camphor, 1,8-cineole, alpha-humulene, isoborneol, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and terpinen-4-ol); and synthetic essential oils comprised of mixtures of major pure compounds in the same ratios as the extracted essential oils were tested for contact, feeding reduction, and repellency against Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) adults. Via topical applications, the three extracted oils had similar toxicity against S. zeamais (LD50, fiducial limits: 18-24 mu g oil/mg insect). T. castaneum had similar sensitivity to all three oils (35-58 mu g/mg), and it was less sensitive than S. zeamais. The LD50 values of synthetic A. conchigera and synthetic Z. zerumbet oils were similar to those of their corresponding extracted essential oils. The synthetic C. zedoaria oils showed lower contact toxicity than the extracted C. zedoaria oils to both insects. Sitophilus zeamais and T. castaneum were sensitive to terpinen-4-ol and isoborneol in contact toxicity tests. In antifeedant tests, the three extracted oils were able to decrease the consumption of flour disks, especially Z. zerumbet oils, whereas both insect species could feed on the flour disks treated with three synthetic essential oils. Only terpinen-4-ol deterred feeding in both insects. In repellency tests, A. conchigera oils at highest concentration repelled S. zeamais and T. castaneum. None of the synthetic essential oils repelled S. zeamais (315 mu l/cm(2)) and T. castaneum (31 mu l/cm(2)). Only terpinen-4-ol showed repellent activity against both insects.

In this study, we evaluated approximately 170 methanol extracts of natural products including Korean herbal medicines for the inhibition of prostaglandin E-2 production (for COX-2 inhibitors) and nitric oxide formation (for iNOS inhibitors) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse macrophages RAW264.7 cells. As a result, several extracts such as Aristolochia debilis, Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum loureirii, Curcuma zedoaria, Eugenia caryophyllata, Pterocarpus santalius, Rehmania glutinosa and Tribulus terrestris showed potent inhibition of COX-2 activity (> 80% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 mug/ml). In addition, the extracts of A. debilis, Caesalpinia sappan, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Daphne genkwa and Morus alba were also considered as potential inhibitors of iNOS activity (> 70% inhibition at the test concentration of 10 mug/ml). These active extracts mediating COX-2 and iNOS inhibitory activities are warranted for further elucidation of active principles for development of new cancer chemopreventive and/or anti-inflammatory agents.

Results: It was found that all formulations of Zingiberaceae plants EOs augmented with E. globulus EO were more effective in oviposition deterrent, ovicidal, and adulticidal activities against the two mosquito species than all of the formulations used without E. globulus EO. Their oviposition deterrent, ovicidal and adulticidal activities were equivalent to those of 10% w/v cypennethrin. In contrast, 70% v/v ethyl alcohol as a control alone was not effective at all. The highest synergistic effect in effective repellency against Ae. albopictus was achieved by 5% Alpinia galanga EO + 5% E. globulus EO and against An. minimus was 5% Zingiber cassumunar EO + 5% E. globulus EO. Moreover, the highest synergistic effects in ovicidal activities against Ae. albopictus and An. minimus were achieved by 10% Zingiber cassumunar EO + 10% E. globulus EO and 5% Curcuma zedoaria EO + 5% E. globulus EO, respectively. For the adulticidal activities, the highest synergistic effect against two mosquitoes was achieved by 5% Curcuma zedoaria EO + 5% E. globulus EO. Conclusions: These results suggest that Zingiberaceae plant EOs augmented with E. globulus EO have a high potential to be developed into oviposition deterrent, ovicidal, and adulticidal agents for controlling populations of Ae. albopictus and An. minimus.

When orally administered 1 day before the injection of adjuvant, the methanol extract of Curcuma phaeocaulis significantly inhibited paw swelling and the serum haptoglobin concentration in adjuvant arthritis mice. Also when orally administered 1 day after the injection of adjuvant, the methanol extract of Curcuma phaeocaulis significantly inhibited paw swelling. Other Curcuma species (Curcuma longa, Curcuma wenyujin, Curcuma kwangsiensis, Curcuma zedoaria and Curcuma aromatica) had no significant inhibitory effects on adjuvant-induced paw swelling. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity was significantly inhibited by the methanol extract of C. phaeocaulis. Curcuminoids' (curcumin, bis-demethoxycurcumin and demethoxycurcumin) were rich in C. longa, but less in C. phaeocaulis and C. aromatica, not in C. wenyujin, C. kwangsiensis and C. zedoaria, suggesting that curcuminoids' contents do not relate to inhibition of arthritis swelling. Therefore, C. phaeocaulis may be a useful drug among Curcuma species for acute inflammation, and the active constituents of C. phaeocaulis are not curcuminoids.

Moreover, to develop a more convenient identification method, amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) analysis of both gene regions was performed on plants. The ARMS method for the 18S rRNA gene was established using two types of forward primers designed based on the nucleotide difference at position 234. When DNAs of four Curcuma species were used as templates, PCR amplification with either of the two primers only generated a fragment of 912 base pairs (bp). However, when DNAs, of the purple-cloud type of C. kwangsiensis and C wenyujin were used, PCR amplifications with both primers unexpectedly generated the fragment, suggesting that these two were heterozygotes. The ARMS method for the trnK gene was also established using a mixture of four types of specific reverse primers designed on the basis of base substitutions and indels among six species, and common reverse and forward primers. C. phaeocaulis or the Chinese population of C. zedoaria, the Japanese population of C. zedoaria or the purple-cloud type of C. kwangsiensis, the pubescent type of C. kwangsiensis or C. wenyujin, and C. aromatica were found to show specific fragments of 730, 185, 527 or 528, and 641 or 642 bp, respectively. All species including C. longa also showed a common fragment of 897-904 bp. Using both ARMS methods, together with information on producing areas, the identification of Curcuma plants was achieved. Moreover, the ARMS method for the trnK gene was also useful for authentication of Curcuma drugs.

The yield of essential oil in the rhizomes ranged from 0.38 ml in Curcuma aeruginosa to 1.4 ml/100 g fw in Curcuma zedoaria. The compounds 1,8 cineole, camphor, camphene, alpha-pinene, and beta-pinene were present in most of the species. Each Curcuma species was characterized by the presence of unique compounds which varied in concentration from 0.25 to 70%. These included alpha-fenchene in Curcuma sylvatica, curcumenene in Curcuma malabarica, elemenone in Curcuma rakthakanta, epicurzerenone and curzerene in Curcuma zedoaria, curdione and xanthorhizol in Curcuma aromatica, and beta-eudesmol in Curcuma aeruginosa. The different species were grouped on the basis of essential oil composition and a dendrogram consisting of four clusters was constructed. In view of the ambiguity existing in the classification of different Curcuma species, the essential oil composition could be an important tool for species identification and authentication.

The last two insects are parasitoids commonly used to control stored-product weevils and moths. The trial was evaluated at 0, 37, 74, 148, 296, 444, 593 mu L/L in air after 12, 24 and 48 h for S. zeamais, T. castaneum and A. calandrae, and 24 h for T. deion. Alpinia conchigera oils were toxic to S. zeamais, T. castaneum and T. deion, while the other two plant oils had low toxicity. Adults of S. zeamais and T castaneum were more susceptible to A. conchigera oils than their eggs, larvae or pupae. Sitophilus zeamais adults (LC50 85 mu L/L in air) were slightly more tolerant of A. conchigera oils than T. castaneum (LC50 73 mu L/L in air) after 48 h exposure. Synthetic essential oils, a mixture of pure compounds in the same ratios of the extracted essential oils, were tested with S. zeamais and T castaneum adults. Synthetic essential oils were more toxic than the extracted essential oils to both insects. Zingiber zerumbet oils (LC50 26 mu L/L in air) and C. zedoaria oils (LC50 25 mu L/L in air) were significantly more toxic to adults of A. calandrae than A. conchigera oils (LC50 37 mu L/L in air) whereas T deion larvae were more sensitive to A. conchigera oils (LC50 62 mu L/L in air) than Z. zerumbet and C. zedoaria oils (LC50 > 593 mu L/L in air). Tribolium castaneum was more susceptible than S. zeamais to the eight pure compounds. Terpinen-4-ol was highly toxic to both insects. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

After model studies, the envisioned derivatization was realized under the rationally designed Bucherer-Bergs reaction conditions to afford unnatural hydantoin with tetrasubstituted carbon from the ethyl acetate extract of Curcuma zedoaria. The reaction proceeded with enough chemoselectivity to identify the desired product from the mixture by the reliable guidance of spectroscopic analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Each test repellent was applied at 1, 5, and 10 % concentrations for testing by arm in cage method. The results showed significant differences in repellency among the repellents by mosquito species. The protection time of the essential oils against Ae. aegypti ranged from 3 to 30 min. According to the Culex mosquito, it showed the protection time ranged from 3 to 260 min. 10 % Boesenbergia rotunda essential oil provided the best efficiency, in which protection time was 4.3 h as equal as DEET. The essential oils which exhibited protection time more than 2 h were those of 10 % Zingiber zerumbet, Litsea petiolata, Curcuma zedoaria, and Zingiber cassumunar essential oils (3.1, 2.8, 2.6, and 2.3 h, respectively). The biting percentage ranged from 0.9 to 18.0 % and 0.8 to 3.6 % against Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. The results revealed that the potential of essential oil extracted from B. rotunda, Z. zerumbet, L. petiolata, C. zedoaria, and Z. cassumunar had attributes of good repellent and deterred biting. We recommend the five essential oils for further study to develop as commercial repellents.

A major mechanism that mediates MDR in cancer is the overexpression of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters. These transporters bind to their respective substrates and catalyze their efflux from cancer cells, thereby lowering the intracellular concentrations of the substrates and thus attenuating or even abolishing their efficacy. In addition, cancer cells can become resistant to drugs via mechanisms that attenuate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest such as alterations in the p53, check point kinase, nuclear factor kappa B, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which beta-elemene, a compound extracted from Rhizoma zedoariae that has clinical antitumor efficacy, overcomes drug resistance in cancer.

However, a mixture of extracted curcuminoids, NADES, and impurities from C. zedoaria was obtained as a slurry at the end of the extraction process. Therefore, further separation and purification were required to obtain the extracted compound in high purity. Herein, two purification methods based on classical column chromatography (CCC) and solid-phase extraction (SPE), were evaluated for the purification of curcuminoids from NADES matrices after extraction. Choline chloride-malic acid-water (CCMA-H2O) and choline chloride-citric acid-water (CCCA-H2O) in the molar ratio of 1:1:18 were selected as NADES matrices due to their high solubility and stabilization capability for curcuminoids. Ethanol conditioned silica gel (60-200 mu m) was applied as the bed resin for CCC, and a C-18 cartridge was used for SPE. Acetonitrile/0.1% acetic acid, water/0.1% acetic acid, and isopropanol/0.1% acetic acid were used as mobile phases for CCC. For SPE, methanol/0.05% acetic acid and water/0.05% acetic acid were applied in the conditioning step, water/0.05% acetic acid in the washing step, and methanol/acetonitrile (1:1) in the eluting step. The SPE method produced higher recovery of curcuminoids from the CCCA- H2O and CCMA-H2O matrices (75.27% and 73.40%, respectively) compared to CCC (51.9% and 61.0%, respectively). After removing the NADES constituents from the crude extract of curcuminoids, recrystallization was attempted.

Molecular cloning of resistance related sequences from wild genotypes can result in efficient turmeric improvement by evolving more effective resistance specificities compared to cultigens. In this study, a PCR mediated approach has been made using degenerate primers designed on conserved region (P-loop and GLPL) of the NBS domain from R-genes that provides the source for cloning analogous sequences called resistance gene candidates (RGCs) from three wild turmeric-Curcuma aromatica, Curcuma angustifolia and Curcuma zedoaria. Twenty-one wild turmeric RGCs were isolated and grouped into four phenetic classes. A strong amino acid identity ranging from 41 to 53% together with presence of internal conserved motifs provided evidence that the isolated RGCs belong to the non-toll interleukin receptor (non-TIR) NBS-LRR R-gene sub-family. Southern hybridization showed a high copy representation of turmeric RGCs. Expression variability of wild turmeric RGCs was analyzed through reverse transcription PCR in root tissues of the three wild turmeric plants resistant or susceptible to Pythium aphanidermatum. Cap12 and Can12 showed a constitutive expression in both resistant and susceptible plants of Curcuma aromatica and Curcuma angustifolia respectively while Czp11 expression was realized only in Pythium aphanidermatum resistant lines of Curcuma zedoaria as well as Curcuma longa L. This result can pave way towards the identification and characterization of a potential Pythium aphanidermatum resistance gene in turmeric.

The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of triploidy and the level of genome size variation among commercially cultivated phyto-oestrogen producing Curcuma and related species in Thailand. Meiosis was also examined in order to validate the triploid status and to infer genomic relationship in the triploids. A total of 47 accessions belonging to C. comosa, C. latifolia, C. sp.'elata-latifolia', C. caesia, C. cf. zedoaroides, C. cf. zedoaria and Curcuma sp. 1 were differentiated by ploidy based on chromosome numbers and by genome size based on flow cytometry data. The results revealed three distinct groups: (1) diploid C. comosa cultivars with small rhizomes, having 2n = 42 and mean 2C DNA content of 1.690 pg; (2) triploid cultivars from all but one Curcuma species investigated, with 2n = 63 and mean 2C DNA content of 2.549 pg; and (3) tetraploid cultivars of C. latifolia and C. cf. zedoaria, with 2n = 84 and mean 2C DNA content of 3.439 pg. The mean triploid genome size is right between the diploid and tetraploid values. Only Curcuma caesia showed statistically significant difference in genome size from all other triploid taxa. The study of male meiosis revealed different meiotic figures. The triploid C. comosa is clearly an autotriploid as it showed 21 trivalents, whereas the diploid C. comosa showed 21 bivalents. This confirms the base number x = 21. Triploid cultivars of C. latifolia and C. sp. 'elata-latifolia' showed irregularities in their meiotic figures, thus indicating allotriploidy.

Nineteen regions of cpDNA were amplified successfully via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using total DNA of all Curcuma plants. Using the intergenic spacer between trnS and trnfM (trnSfM), all four Curcuma plant species were correctly identified. In addition, the number of AT repeats in the trnSfM region was predictive of the curcumin content in the rhizome of C. longa.

Recent studies have significantly improved our understanding of anti-cancer activities and underlying molecular mechanisms of this Chinese medicine. This review presents these novel findings regarding the unique properties of beta-elemene as an agent for cancer treatment, with an emphasis on multi-targeting biological and molecular regulation.

Detection of plant-based adulterants in turmeric powder using DNA barcoding	PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cassava; Curcuma zedoaria; fillers; ITS; rbcL; reference library; wheat	AUTHENTICATION; RDNA; TOOL	Context: In its powdered form, turmeric [Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae)], a spice of medical importance, is often adulterated lowering its quality. Objective: The study sought to detect plant-based adulterants in traded turmeric powder using DNA barcoding. Materials and methods: Accessions of Curcuma longa L., Curcuma zedoaria Rosc. (Zingiberaceae), and cassava starch served as reference samples. Three barcoding loci, namely ITS, rbcL, and matK, were used for PCR amplification of the reference samples and commercial samples representing 10 different companies. PCR success rate, sequencing efficiency, occurrence of SNPs, and BLAST analysis were used to assess the potential of the barcoding loci in authenticating the traded samples of turmeric. Results: The PCR and sequencing success of the loci rbcL and ITS were found to be 100%, whereas matK showed no amplification. ITS proved to be the ideal locus because it showed greater variability than rbcL in discriminating the Curcuma species. The presence of C. zedoaria could be detected in one of the samples whereas cassava starch, wheat, barley, and rye in other two samples although the label claimed nothing other than turmeric powder in the samples. Discussion and conclusion: Unlabeled materials in turmeric powder are considered as adulterants or fillers, added to increase the bulk weight and starch content of the commodity for economic gains. These adulterants pose potential health hazards to consumers who are allergic to these plants, lowering the product's medicinal value and belying the claim that the product is gluten free. The study proved DNA barcoding as an efficient tool for testing the integrity and the authenticity of commercial products of turmeric.	[Parvathy, V. A.; Swetha, V. P.; Sheeja, T.

In this paper, based on species-specific nucleotide sequences, the application of a new method, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was investigated to identify Curcuma plants more conveniently. First, three types of reverse primer were synthesized in different lengths, 34 mer, 26 mer, and 30 mer, to anneal the template DNAs from each species at sites immediately upstream from substitution positions 177 and 645, and at the site including the 4-base insertion from 728 to 731, respectively. After single-base extension reaction of these primers using fluorescent-labeled ddNTPs and PCR products of the trnK gene region as template, the resulting products were detected using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. The electrophoretogram showed three or two peaks at different positions depending on the 27 mer, 31 mer, and 35 mer product lengths. Each peak was derived from the incorporated fluorescent-labeled ddNMPs complementary to template nucleotides at positions 645, 724, and 177, respectively. C phaeocaulis showed three peaks of ddCMP, ddAMP, and ddAMP. The other three species showed two peaks derived from 27 mer and 35 mer products: peaks of ddCMP and ddAMP in C. longa, those of ddCMP and ddTMP in C zedoaria, and those of ddTMP and ddAMP in C. aromatica. Thus SNP analysis to identify four Curcuma plants was newly developed.

All the species were separated into 3 clusters using UPGMA. C. aromatica, C. leucorrhiza, and C. brog formed a cluster within which C. longa and C. zedoaria formed a subgroup. C. harita was genetically distinct from all the other Curcuma species. Since it is difficult to distinguish different species by leaf morphology, the RAPID pattern has high utility in identification of starchy Curcuma species.	[Angel, G.

In this study, four Curcuma species (C zedoaria, C. xanthorrhiza, C. aeruginosa and C. mangga) were compared in terms of their total phenolic contents (TPC), and bioactivities including free radical scavenging, alpha-glucosidase and nitric oxide (NO) inhibition. Their phytochemical constituents were also determined by a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) based metabolomics approach. The species were dried using three drying methods (air, freeze and oven) and extracted with two ethanol ratios (50 and 100%). The correlations between TPC and bioactivities, with phytochemical constituents were obtained using partial least square (PLS) regression. The results showed that C. xanthorrhiza had the highest TPC, antioxidant and NO inhibitory activities, whereas C. mangga showed the highest alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Notable and clear separations among the four species and the three drying methods for C. xanthorrhiza and C. mangga were revealed by principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA scores plot showed close relationship between C. xanthorrhiza and C. mangga, and were separated from C zedoaria and C. aeruginosa. The PLS model indicated that curcumin, xanthorrhizol, 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxypheny1)-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxypheny1)-(1E,6E)-1,6-heptadiene-3,4-dione and demethoxycurcumin were significantly correlated with the higher antioxidant and NO inhibitory activities as demonstrated by C. xanthorrhiza. Meanwhile, zerumin B, dehydrocurdione, (E)-labda-8(17),12-diene-15,16-dial, calcaratarins A and curcuzederone were present in C. mangga contributed to the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The freeze dried samples of all the absolute ethanol extracts of Curcuma species exhibited significant bioactivities with the highest contents of metabolites. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Two laboratory-reared mosquito species, Anopheles dirus, the major malaria vector in Thailand, and Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever in urban areas, were used. All of the volatile oils exerted significant larvicidal activity against the two mosquito species after 24-h exposure. Essential oil from mullilam was the most effective against the larvae of A. aegypti, while A. dirus larvae showed the highest susceptibility to zedoary oil. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Through bioassay-guided separation, two diarylheptanoids [7-(4"-hydroxy-3"-methoxyphenyl-l-phenylhept-4-en-3-one and 3,5-dihydroxy-1,7-diphenylheptane] and a flavonol constituent (galangin) Substantially inhibited LPS-induced NO production with IC50 values of 33-62 mu M. To clarify structure-activity relationships of diarylheptanoids, related diarylheptanoids from Curcuma Zedoaria were examined. Results indicate that the double bond or enone moiety at the 1-7 positions is important for the activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chemical pediculicides have lost their efficacy because lice have developed resistance to them. Therefore, alternative pediculicides such as essential oils and herbal products have been proposed for treating head lice infestation. Study design: To determine the efficacy of essential oils from three Zingiberaceae plants (Curcuma xanthorrhiza, Curcuma zedoaria and Zingiber zerumbet) against head lice eggs and to investigate an augmenting substance (Eucalyptus globulus EO) for improving the efficacy of these essential oils in killing head lice eggs, especially on the inhibition of their hatching process. Permethrin pediculicide, soyabean oil, and drinking water were used as positive, negative, and neutral controls, respectively. Methods: An immersion test was used to evaluate the ovicidal activity of 12 essential oil formulations. Head lice eggs were immersed for 1, 5 and 10 min in the treatments. Mortality rate was observed on day 7 and day 14; mortality was checked under a stereomicroscope. Results: All head lice eggs that were immersed in a combination of 10% C. zedoaria EO and 10% E. globulus EO for 5 min did not hatch at all for 7-14 days of incubation. All head lice eggs that were immersed in soyabean oil and drinking water for 1, 5, and 10 min showed 100% hatching rate in 7-14 days of incubation. All head lice eggs that were immersed in permethrin pediculicide for 1, 5 min, showed 100% hatching rate, but when they were immersed for 10 min, permethrin provided 4.0-6.0% inhibition rate with 94.0-96.0% hatching rate for 7-14 days of incubation. All combinations of Zingiberaceae EOs and E. globulus EO at low and high concentrations (5 and 10%) exhibited high ovicidal activities against head lice eggs, and the combinations showed a synergistic effect with an increase in the inhibition rate of more than 50%. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that Zingiberaceae EOs augmented with E. globulus EO are promising ovicidal agents for head lice control.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the SJT-induced apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells remain unclear. In the present study, SJT was demonstrated to show cytotoxic effect and induce apoptotic cell death via mitochondrial regulation in KLE endometrial cancer cells. Linderae Radix, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Zedoariae Rhizoma, Trogopterorum Faeces and Agelicae Gigantis Radix were found to be the potent constituent herbs of SJT to significantly decrease the viability of KLE cells by a tetra zolium salt (XTT) assay. Apoptotic bodies were observed in SJT-treated KLE cells by 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and TdT-mediated-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. SJT also increased sub-G1 DNA contents of the cell cycle undergoing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that SJT activated caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, this study shows that SJT exerts anti-tumor activity against KLE endometrial cancer cells via mitochondrial dependent apoptosis induction.

The objective of the study is to find biomarker compound(s) in some Indian Curcuma species with the aim to identify, through metabolite profiling and chemometric approach. Total 45 terpenes, including 19 monoterpenes and 16 sesquiterpenes could be detected in the hexane extract of five species of Curcuma e.g. C. amada, C. aromatica, C. caesia, C. longa, and C. zedoaria. Based on terpene profile, dendrogram and OPLSDA separated all the five species from each other. Multivariate analysis carried out considering C. longa as one group and the other species as another group revealed that sesquiterpenes and a few monoterpenes played important role to distinguish species particularly C. longa. Ar-Curcumene, beta-sesquiphellandrene, and alpha-zingiberene were detected in only C. longa. Curzerene, isoborneol, germacrene D could not be detected from C. longa and C. amada. C. caesia is characterized by the presence of delta-cadinene.

Isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pestalotiopsis sp., and Phomopsis sp. Antifungal bioassays of rhizome crude extracts of the Zingiberaceae family, Alpinia galanga, Zingiber montanum, Curcuma longa, and C. zedoaria were tested against the postharvest pathogens. The antifungal activity of the lipophillic phase of the crude extracts was determined by a micro dilution technique. A. galanga extracts were found to be the most effective, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 78 mu g/ml against C. gloeosporioides. Fraction sample B from column chromatography showed spore inhibition at a MIC of 1,250 mu g/ml. A 10,000 ppm extract in 5% methanol was most effective in controlling fruit rot caused by Phomopsis sp., and wrapping fruits with soaked extract paper decreased disease incidence caused by Pestalotiopsis sp.

The most effective medicinal plants were Paeonia suffruticosa Andrew, followed in order by Lonicera japonica Thunb., Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe, and Pueraria thunbergiana Benth. In addition, root bark of P. suffruticosa was partitioned with organic solvents of different polarities, and the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction showed the strongest ONOO- scavenging activity. Methyl gallate, a plant-derived phenolic compound identified from the EtOAc fraction, exerted strong ONOO- scavenging activity. The in vivo therapeutic potential of methyl gallate was investigated using lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Oral administration of methyl gallate protected against acute renal injury and exhibited potential anti-inflammatory properties through an increase in antioxidant activity and decrease in nuclear factor-kappa B activity.

It contains roughly three to fourteen kinds of herbs, depending on the manufacturer. A cotton bag containing these herbs is placed on a hot steam pot, which activates the herbs. It is then pressed, or 'Prakop' onto a painful site on the human body for the purpose of pain relief. It is thought that the active ingredients come from the essential oils of the herbs Phlai (Zingiber cassumunar) and Curcuma (Curcuma longa, Curcuma zedoaria). Because of the varying contents and quality of different herbal formulations, modern investigations require some form of standardization, at least for research purposes. Quality control can be performed by using a gas chromatography (GC) fingerprint of an essential oil formulation. For this purpose, GC fingerprints were obtained on specific combinations of LPK in Thailand.

F. graminearum grew poorly on B-type starches and the accumulation of biomass was similar to that obtained for fungi cultivated under carbohydrate starvation conditions. In comparison, three- to fivefold higher accumulation of fungal biomass was observed for growth on the A-, C- and A?+?Vh-type starches. Fungal glucoamylase and a-amylase activity increased over time in the presence of native starch granules. Interestingly, resistant B-type starches induced the highest amylolytic activity indicating that F. graminearum interacts with B-type granules although only limited degradation occur. Starch degradation products maltose and malto-oligosacharides was found to increase glucoamylase and a-amylase activity, whereas glucose acted as a catabolite repressor.

A total of 21 turmeric and 9 curry commercially available samples were analyzed in triplicate after extraction with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The results demonstrated the feasibility of non-targeted UHPLC-HRMS fingerprints for sample classification, showing very good classification capabilities by partial least squares regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), with 100% classification rates being obtained by PLS-DA when randomly selected samples were processed as "unknown" ones. Besides, turmeric curcuma species (Curcuma longavs.Curcuma zedoaria) and turmericCurcuma longavarieties (Madras, Erodes, and Alleppey) discrimination was also observed by PLS-DA when using the proposed fingerprints as chemical descriptors. As a conclusion, non-targeted UHPLC-HRMS fingerprinting is a suitable methodology for the characterization, classification, and authentication of turmeric and curry samples, without the requirement of using commercially available standards for quantification nor the necessity of metabolite identification.

J	Park, JH; Jung, JW; Ahn, YJ; Kwon, HW				Park, Ji Hyun; Jung, Je Won; Ahn, Young-Joon; Kwon, Hyung Wook			Neuroprotective properties of phytochemicals against paraquat-induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Drosophila melanogaster; Oxidative stress; Paraquat; Neurotoxicity; Phytochemicals	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LIFE-SPAN; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; GENE-EXPRESSION; EXPOSURE; GLUTATHIONE; MODELS	Environmental toxicants like paraquat (PQ) induce the increase of oxidative stress, which is likely to lead to various neuropathological symptoms. Although the Drosophila system is applicable for anti-oxidative and neuroprotective drug discovery, this system remains to be more exploited in various aspects. In this study, using Drosophila as a model animal, we have examined the anti-oxidative and neuroprotective properties of plant-derived compounds against oxidative damage and neurotoxicity induced by paraquat, which is a widely used herbicide. In this study. paraquat showed LC50 at 24.7 mM to adult males of Drosophila melanogaster within 24 h. Dietary feeding of curcumin, quercetin, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Zedoariae rhizoma extracts prior to paraquat exposure extended lifespan and enhanced motor activities of flies. These compounds modulated the expression level of several genes associated with anti-oxidative and anti-aging effects such assod1, sod2, cat, gstD1, and mth genes. Also, same treatments of phytochemicals to flies ameliorated other oxidative stress index factors such as ROS levels and superoxide dismutase. In contrast, no significant effects on catalase activities were observed. Additionally, the dietary feeding of phytochemical substances also reduced acetylcholine esterase activities, which were dramatically increased by paraquat treatment, implying that these phytochemicals also affected neuronal systems. Present study demonstrates that the dietary feeding of phytochemicals prior to paraquat exposure has anti-oxidative and neural protective effects, which leads to the recovery of behaviors and lifespan in fruit flies.

Bioprospecting of Bacterial Endophytes from Curcuma aeruginosa, Curcuma xanthorrhiza and Curcuma zedoariaas Antibacterial Against Pathogenic Bacteria	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOSCIENCES (ICOBIO)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Biosciences (ICoBio) - From Genes to Ecosystems	AUG 08-10, 2017	Bogor, INDONESIA	Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Math & Nat Sci		endophytic bacteria; antibacterial; C. aeruginosa; C. xanthorrhiza; C. zedoa	ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; AMYLOLIQUEFACIENS	Bacterial endophytes live in plant tissue and produce secondary metabolites that potentially have antimicrobial properties. The purpose of this research was to determine the beneficial role of endophytic bacteria isolated from three different local plants namely, TemuIreng (Curcuma aeruginosa), Temulawak (Curcuma xanthorrhiza) and TemuPutih (Curcuma zedoaria) as the potent antibacterial agent against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii. The study used descriptive method that includes isolation, identification of bacterial endophytes and their biological activity as antibacterial. A total of six endophytic bacteria have been successfully isolated and identified from the three different plants. They were identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus cereus from TemuIreng, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Lysinibacillus sphaericus from Temulawak, as well as Bacillus sp. 1 and Bacillus sp. 2 from TemuPutih. Antibacterial activity test showed that B. amyloliquefaciens from Temulawak exhibited 16 and 8 mm inhibition zone against MRSA and K. pneumonia bacteria, respectively. Whereas Bacillus sp. 1 and Bacillus sp. 2 from TemuPutih can only inhibit K. pneumoniae bacteria with 7 mm inhibitory zone.	[Indrawati, I.; Rossiana, N.; Diresna, D.

The MTT assay was used to determine the effects of -elemene in combination with other anticancer drugs on ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we used [H-3]-paclitaxel accumulation, efflux assay, immunofluorescence experiments, western blot assays and docking analysis to ascertain the mechanism of action of -elemene. The incubation of KB-C2 cells overexpressing ABCB1 transporter with -elemene (100 M) significantly augmented the antineoplastic efficacy of colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel when compared to KB-C2 cells incubated with these drugs alone. In HEK293 cells overexpressing the ABCB1 transporter, -elemene significantly increased the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel. In addition, 100 M of -elemene significantly increased the accumulation of [H-3]-paclitaxel and this was due to a decrease in [H-3]-paclitaxel efflux when compared to controls. The incubation of KB-C2 cells with -elemene (100 M) for 72 h did not significantly alter the expression of ABCB1 protein levels. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that -elemene did not significantly alter the subcellular localization of the ABCB1 transporter. Docking analysis indicated that -elemene binds to the drug-binding site of ABCB1 transporter. Finally, -elemene at 100 M partially (similar to 50%) increased the sensitivity of the BCRP-overexpressing cell line, NCI-H460/MX20, to mitoxantrone, but -elemene did not significantly alter the resistance of MRP1-transfected HEK293/MRP1 cells to vincristine. Overall, our in vitro findings indicated that -elemene potentiates the cytotoxic effects of various antineoplastic drugs in cell lines overexpressing the ABCB1 transporter and that this is due to the inhibition of the efflux component of the ABCB1 transporter.

In this study, we optimized the preparation methods, prescription, and process of galactosylated curcumol liposomes (Gal-Cur-L). The experimental results showed that the encapsulation efficiency, particle diameter, and stability coefficient of Gal-Cur-L obtained by the two-step emulsification method were improved compared with those of it obtained by other methods. Single-factor investigation showed that two factors, pH and the amount of triolein, contribute at least partly to the encapsulation efficiency and particle diameter of Gal-Cur-L. The best prescription and process were obtained through orthogonal test: the ratio of lecithin to cholesterol was 2:1, the ratio of drug to lipid was 1:2, and the amount of ether and Twain-80 were 4 ml and 1.6 g/L, respectively, 15 min for ultrasonic time, 100 W for ultrasonic power, and 20 min for homogeneous time. Using the best method, prescription, and process mentioned earlier, the basic test results of Gal-Cur-L were obtained, which demonstrated that our methods, prescription, and process of Gal-Cur-L were applicable. The encouraging results of this study provided references for the research of liver-targeting reagents of curcumol.

Liver targeting reagents with galactose residues, which selectively combine to asialoglyco protein receptors, have previously been used to improve liposome-encapsulated drug accumulation within liver cells. They lead to a reduction in liver cancer cell growth and have been used to cure certain hepatic diseases. In the present study, curcumol, which is the primary active component of Chinese traditional medicine Rhizoma zedoariae, was encapsulated in galactosylated-liposomes to enhance its anti-liver cancer efficacy. Galactosylated-liposomes and normal liposomes were labeled with propidium iodide. Galactosylated-liposomes with increasing concentrations of galactosylated-stearate (Gal-s) had a notably increased level of uptake in HepG2 cells (hepatoblastoma) compared with SGC-7901 (gastric cancer) and A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) cells. When the percentage of Gal-s reached 20%, liposome uptake plateaued. In the in vitro anti-liver cancer experiment, the anti-liver cancer efficacy of galactosylated-curcumol-liposomes increased significantly more compared with normal curcumol liposomes and free curcumol as indicated by cell survival rate and lactate dehydrogenase release rate. Collectively, these results demonstrate that galactosylated-liposomes are able to enhance the in vitro liver-targeting effect and anti-liver cancer efficacy of curcumol.

We have shown previously that beta-elemene increases cisplatin cytotoxicity and enhances cisplatin sensitivity via blocking cell cycle progression at G2/M phase in resistant ovarian tumor cells. In the current study, we asked whether beta-elemene-augmented cisplatin activity in ovarian carcinoma cells is mediated through the induction of apoptosis. Here, we show that beta-elemene triggered apoptotic cell death in chemoresistant human ovarian cancer A2780/CP and MCAS cells in a dose-and time-dependent fashion, as assessed by six different apoptosis assays. Intriguingly, beta-elemene was a stronger inducer of apoptosis than cisplatin in this model system, and a synergistic effect on induction of cell death was observed when the tumor cells were treated with both agents. Furthermore, beta-elemene plus cisplatin exposure significantly disrupted the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) and increased the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. The combination treatment with both compounds also induced increases in caspase-3/8/9 activities and caspase-9 cleavage, enhanced protein expression of Bax and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser-70, and reduced the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X-L in the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, these data indicate that beta-elemene sensitizes chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and that the augmented effect of beta-elemene on cisplatin cytotoxicity and sensitivity in resistant ovarian tumor cells is mediated through a mitochondria-and caspase-dependent cell death pathway.

In this study, the crude rhizome protein extract and associated pepsin/pancreatin protein hydrolysate of 15 plants in the Zingiberaceae family were screened using the DPPH method for antioxidant activity. The protein hydrolysate of C. zedoaria possessed the highest antioxidant activity (IC50 of 25.7 +/- 6.3 mu g/mL), which was close to that of the reference ascorbic acid (IC50 of 22.3 +/- 1.8 mu g/mL). After enrichment by Q Sepharose ion exchange chromatography using a five step elution gradient of increasing NaCl concentration (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1M), the fraction eluting in the 0.5M NaC1 (F50) showed the highest antioxidant activity (IC50 of 41.78 +/- 2.9 mu g/mL), and was found to have weak in vitro cytotoxicity against the HEP-G2 and SW620 cell lines (IC50 of 200.8 +/- 11.8 and 241.0 +/- 9.3 mu g/mL, respectively), but not the BT474, CHAGO and KAT073 cell lines.

In this paper, two such compounds, isolated from garlic and from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, are described for review. Elemene, isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Rhizoma zedoariae, was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in human and murine tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. This novel antineoplastic agent has substantial clinical activity against various tumors. The in vitro effect of elemene on the growth of leukemia cells was evaluated by MTT assay. The IC50 values of elemene for promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and erythroleukemia K562 cells were 27.5 mu g/mL and 81 mu g/mL, respectively, while IC50 for peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was 254.3 mu g/mL. The inhibitory effect of elemene on proliferation of HL-60 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest from S to G(2)M phase transition and with induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis of tumor cells was confirmed by DNA ladder formation on gel electrophoresis and characteristic ultrastructural alterations. The results also demonstrated that inhibitory effects of allicin, a natural organosulfide from garlic, on proliferation of tumor cells were associated with the cell cycle blockage of S/G(2)M boundary phase and induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest that induction of apoptosis may contribute to the mechanisms of antitumor activity of elemene and allicin, which merit investigation as potential chemoprevention agents in humans.

Previously, the potential of ZO was discovered against lethal and acute liver injury (ALI) mice with little impact on the immune, which deserved further study. Methods: An approach combined systems pharmacology with GC-MS metabolomics was applied for predicting pathways affected by ZO. Subsequently, H2O2 and tertbutyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) were respectively applied to induce the ALI model in vitro for validation. Results: First, systems pharmacology and intracellular metabolites suggested that ZO might regulate oxidative stress via PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 pathway, TCA cycle, pantothenate, and CoA biosynthesis, beta-alanine metabolism, and propanoate metabolism. Further, levels of ALT, AST, ROS, T-AOC, MDA, GR, Delta psi m, and related proteins affected by ZO had been detected to validate the above mechanisms using dual cell models. Conclusion: ZO could protect the L02 cells against ALI by regulating the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 pathway, as well as restore the function of mitochondria and redox imbalance damaged by toxicants. This work has uncovered the nonimmune mechanisms of ZO against ALI to provide the basis for relevant research and disease treatment.

Many species in genus Curcuma were rich with phenolic compounds. The total phenolic content (TPC) of dried rhizomes of Curcuma longa was the highest of all (5.530 g of GA equivalents/1 g of dried rhizome). The average antioxidant properties in the DPPH test was reported in MeOH extracts of the rhizome and leaf samples of four species. Further the MeOH extracts exhibited the inhibitory activities toward alpha-amylase enzyme with IC50 values ranging from 6.455 mu g/ml to 307.475 mu g/ml. The present study shows that Sri Lankan Curcuma species have a potency to be used as antioxidant and antidiabetic agents. This information particularly physicochemical constants such as moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash and water-soluble ash values will be helpful in standardization of quality, purity and authentication of these medicinal plants for preventing its raw materials adulteration.

Here, we aim to investigate the anti-breast cancer and chemosensitizing function of Ai Du Qing (ADQ) formula made up of Hedyotis diffusa, Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Rosc., Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. Our findings revealed that ADO significantly inhibited cell proliferation in both parental and chemo-resistant breast cancer cells, but with little cytotoxcity effects on the normal cells. Besides, ADQ was found to facilitate the G2/M arresting and apoptosis induction effects of paclitaxel. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis further demonstrated that ADQ yielded 132 candidate compounds and 297 potential targets, and shared 22 putative targets associating with breast cancer chemoresponse. Enrichment analysis and experimental validation demonstrated that ADQ might improve breast cancer chemosensitivity via inhibiting caveolin-1, which further triggered expression changes of cell cycle-related proteins p21/cyclinB1 and apoptosis-associated proteins PARP1, BAX and Bcl-2. Besides, ADQ enhanced in vivo paclitaxel chemosensitivity on breast cancer. Our study not only uncovers the novel function and mechanisms of ADQ in chemosensitizing breast cancer at least partly via targeting caveolin-1, but also sheds novel light in utilizing network pharmacology in Chinese Medicine research.

In order to discover new natural products against HAT, thirty-seven Vietnamese essential oils (EOs) were screened for their activity in vitro on Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb) and cytotoxicity on mammalian cells (WI38, J774). Based on the selectivity indices (SIs), the more active and selective EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography. The anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity of some major compounds (isolated or commercial) were also determined. Our results showed for the first time the selective anti-trypanosomal effect of four EOs, extracted from three Zingiberaceae species (Curcuma longa, Curcuma zedoaria, and Zingiber officinale) and one Lauraceae species (Litsea cubeba) with IC50 values of 3.17 +/- 0.72, 2.51 +/- 1.08, 3.10 +/- 0.08, and 2.67 +/- 1.12 nL/mL respectively and SI > 10. Identified compounds accounted for more than 85% for each of them. Among the five major components of Curcuma longa EO, curlone is the most promising anti-trypanosomal candidate with an IC50 of 1.38 +/- 0.45 mu g/mL and SIs of 31.7 and 18.2 compared to WI38 and J774 respectively.

Seventeen major compounds including flavonoids, sesquiterpenoids and cinnamic acid derivatives were isolated and identified based on their NMR and mass spectra, and by comparison with published data. All compounds were studied for contact toxicity against larvae of the polyphagous pest insect Spodoptera littoralis. Nine compounds including the most active sesquiterpenoids xanthorrhizol and furanodienone showed pronounced toxicity against neonate larvae of S. littoralis in a contact residue bioassay. The LD50 of xanthorrhizol following topical application was found to vary between 6.92 and 8.13 mumol kg-1 fresh weight irrespective of the larval stages studied. In a time course experiment significant mortality of the larvae following topical contact with xanthorrhizol was observed as early as one hour following treatment, whereas all of the moribund larvae died within the first six hours of observation. None of the compounds studied, however, including xanthorrhizol caused significant mortality of neonate larvae of S. littoralis when incorporated into artificial diet, suggesting inactivation of the compounds in the larval gut.

However, the underlying mechanism by which this agent inhibits human lung cancer cell growth has not been well elucidated. In this study, we showed that -elemene inhibits human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell growth, and increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and AMPK. Moreover, -elemene inhibited expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which was not observed in the presence of the specific inhibitors of ERK (PD98059) or AMPK (compound C). Overexpression of DNMT1 reversed the effect of -elemene on cell growth. Interestingly, metformin not only reversed the effect of -elemene on phosphorylation of Akt but also strengthened the -elemene-reduced DNMT1. In addition, -elemene suppressed Sp1 protein expression, which was eliminated by either ERK1/2 or AMPK inhibitor. Conversely, overexpression of Sp1 antagonized the effect of -elemene on DNMT1 protein expression and cell growth. Taken together, our results show that -elemene inhibits NSCLC cell growth via ERK1/2- and AMPK-mediated inhibition of transcription factor Sp1, followed by reduction in DNMT1 protein expression. Metformin augments the effect of -elemene by blockade of Akt signalling and additively inhibition of DNMT1 protein expression. The reciprocal ERK1/2 and AMPK signalling pathways contribute to the overall responses of -elemene. This study reveals a potential novel mechanism by which -elemene inhibits growth of NSCLC cells.

From the active fraction, four curcuminoids (curcumin, dihydrocurcumin, tetra-hydrodemethoxycurcumin, and tetrahydrobisdemethoxycurcumin) were isolated together with two bisabolane-type sesquiterpenes, and the effects of four curcuminoids from Thai zedoary and several related compounds on the degranulation were examined. Among them, curcumin showed the highest activity against beta-hexosaminidase release with IC50 of 5.3 hM, followed by bisdemethoxycurcumin (IC50 = 11muM). With regard to the structural requirements of curcuminoids for the activity, the conjugated olefins at the 1-7 positions and the 4'- or 4"-hydroxyl groups of curcuminoids were suggested to be essential for the strong activity, whereas the 3'- or 3"-methoxyl group only enhanced the activity. Furthermore, effects of curcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin on calcium ionophores (A23187 and ionomycin)-induced degranulation and antigen-induced release of TNF-alpha and IL-4 were examined.

Two of 10 chloroplast gene regions (trnS-trnfM and trnK2-trnQr) showed differential PCR amplification across the taxa. Restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR products revealed interspecific variability. The restriction patterns were used to classify the regions as either highly conserved or variable across the taxa. None of the regions was highly conserved across the four genera, and the level of conservation varied. The gene region trnS-trnfM appeared to display interspecific variability among most of the species. However, the relative efficiency of different restriction enzymes depended on the gene regions and genera investigated. Cluster analysis revealed interspecific discrimination among the taxa. The two Curcuma species (Curcuma zedoaria and Curcuma xanthorrhiza) appeared to be identical, thus supporting their recent classification as synonyms. The results provide the basis for selecting specific combinations of restriction enzymes and gene regions of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) to identify interspecific variation in the Zingiberaceae and to identify both highly conserved and variable regions. Overall, cpDNA depicted comparatively diverse genetic profile of the studied germplasm. The genetic information revealed here can be applied to the conservation and future breeding of Zingiber and Curcuma species.	[Ahmad, D.; Kikuchi, A.; Jatoi, S. A.; Mimura, M.; Watanabe, K.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the effect and mechanism of ZTO in human colon cancer cells. The aim of this study was to examine the potential efficacy of ZTO against human colon cancer cells (HCT116) and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of its anti-tumor effects. The anti-proliferative activity of ZTO was determined by the MTT assay, cell counts and colony formation assay. Senescent cells were detected using SA-11-Gal staining, while apoptosis and the CD44 subpopulation were evaluated by flow cytometry. The expression levels of senescence- and apoptosis-related proteins were examined using western blotting. The results showed that treatment with ZTO significantly inhibited the growth of HCT116 cells and caused senescence and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Western blotting revealed that ZTO significantly increased the expression of senescence- and apoptosisrelated proteins p16, p21, and p53 and the phosphorylation of ERK. Moreover, ZTO treatment reduced the cancer stem-like CD44 positive cell population. These findings suggest that ZTO inhibits human colon cancer cells by inducing senescence and apoptosis.

It thus might be a candidate anti-flammatory and cancer chemopreventive agent. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of action of curdione on cancer cells are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of curdione on breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Xenograft nude mice were used to detect the effect of curdione on breast cancer in vivo; we also tested the effect of curdione on breast cancer in vitro by MTT, Flow cytometry, JC-I assay, and western blot. Results: Firstly, we found that curdione significantly suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse breast tumor model in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, curdione treatment inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, after curdione treatment, increase of impaired mitochondrial membrane potential occurred in a concentration dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins including cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax was increased in curdione treatment groups, while the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was decreased. Inhibitors of caspase-3 were used to confirm that curdione induced apoptosis. Conclusions: Overall, our observations first suggested that curdione inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis. These results might provide some molecular basis for the anti-cancer activity of curdione.

Due to the commercial popularity of C. longa, economic adulteration and contamination with botanical additives and chemical substances has increased. This study used FT-IR spectroscopy for identifying and estimating white turmeric (Curcuma zedoaria), and Sudan Red G dye mixed with yellow turmeric powder. Fifty replicates of yellow turmericSudan Red mixed samples (1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% Sudan Red, w/w) and fifty replicates of yellow turmericwhite turmeric mixed samples (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% white turmeric, w/w) were prepared. The IR spectra of the pure compounds and mixtures were analyzed. The 748 cm(-1) Sudan Red peak and the 1078 cm(-1) white turmeric peak were used as spectral fingerprints. A partial least square regression (PLSR) model was developed for each mixture type to estimate adulteration concentrations. The coefficient of determination (R-v(2)) for the Sudan Red mixture model was 0.97 with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) equal to 1.3%. R-v(2) and RMSEP for the white turmeric model were 0.95 and 3.0%, respectively. Our results indicate that the method developed in this study can be used to identify and quantify yellow turmeric powder adulteration.

These two compounds, isolated from C. zedoaria rhizomes were studied for their binding to human serum albumin (HSA) using the fluorescence quench titration method. Molecular docking was also performed to get a more detailed insight into their interaction with HSA at the binding site. Additions of these sesquiterpenes to HSA produced significant fluorescence quenching and blue shifts in the emission spectra of HSA. Analysis of the fluorescence data pointed toward moderate binding affinity between the ligands and HSA, with curcumenone showing a relatively higher binding constant (2.46 x 10(5) M-1) in comparison to curcumenol (1.97 x 10(4) M-1). Cluster analyses revealed that site I is the preferred binding site for both molecules with a minimum binding energy of -6.77 kcal center dot mol(-1). However, binding of these two molecules to site II cannot be ruled out as the binding energies were found to be -5.72 and -5.74 kcal center dot mol(-1) for curcumenol and curcumenone, respectively. The interactions of both ligands with HSA involved hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding.

There are limited reports on the use of this agent against THP-1 cells employing a mechanistic study. Therefore, as a foremost aim of the present study, the cytotoxic effect of elemene and its mechanism will be elucidated. For this aim, the method adopted was to treat THP-1 cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner with elemene and the cytotoxicity to be evaluated. The mRNA expressions of a set of autophagy and apoptosis related genes will be analyzed by quantitative PCR. The findings indicate that the IC50 values for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of treated THP-1 cells were 64.71, 42.19, 25.29 and 20.21 mu g/mL respectively. The expressions of autophagy related genes such as Beclin-1, LC3II, ATG-5 and XBP-1 were upregulated. The expressions of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 was upregulated, whereas, the expression of pro-apoptotic Box was downregulated. Interestingly, the expressions of Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 were upregulated. To summarize, autophagy might have occurred in endoplasmic reticulum and there might be a crosstalk with apoptosis which could be the rationale behind the cytotoxic effects of elemene on THP-1 cells. Therefore, beta- elemene could be a potential therapeutic agent for leukemia.

Some treatments, including vaccines and potential drugs, are still developed. This study investigated the bioactive compounds of Zingiber officinale, Kaempferia rotunda, and Curcuma zedoaria as a potential inhibitor for ACE2 and RdRP proteins. Molecular docking was used for screening the bioactive compounds as ACE2 and RdRP inhibitors. Shogaol (CID 5281794), zingerone (CID 31211), chalcone (CID 637760), Ar-turmerone (CID 558221), bisdemothxycurcumin (CID 5315472), and curcuminoid (CID 101341353) interacted with angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor-2/ACE2 (PDB ID 2xd3) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase/RdRP (PDB ID 6xqb), then analyzed using Discovery studio v.19 program. Shogaol, zingerone, chalcone, ar-turmerone, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and curcuminoid bound to ACE2 and RdRP protein in some active sites. Zingerone, chalcone, and ar-turmerone are attached to the ACE-2 and then RdRP protein in similar active sites, suggesting those compounds stabilize the complex ACE-2 and RdRP protein. Shogaol interacted with the RdRP and ACE2 protein amino acid residues in the Shogaol-RdRP+ACE2 complex, indicating shogaol blocks the RdRP-ACE2 interaction. Then, bisdemethoxycurcumin and curcuminoid change the binding sites of ACE2 and RdRP protein when both compounds are bound to RdRP protein. This study suggested that shogaol, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and curcuminoid are potential drugs for COVID-19 prevention.

In this work, targeted liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) polyphenolic and curcuminoid profiles were evaluated as chemical descriptors to deal with the characterization and classification of turmeric and curry samples. The profiles corresponding to bioactive substances were obtained by TraceFinder(TM)software using accurate mass databases with 53 and 24 polyphenolic and curcuminoid related compounds, respectively. For that purpose, 21 turmeric and 9 curry samples commercially available were analyzed in triplicate by a simple liquid-solid extraction procedure using dimethyl sulfoxide as extracting solvent. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed profiles were excellent chemical descriptors for sample characterization and classification by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), achieving 100% classification rates. Curcuminoids and some specific phenolic acids such astrans-cinnamic, ferulic and sinapic acids, helped on the discrimination of turmeric samples; polyphenols, in general, were responsible for the curry sample distinction. Besides, the combination of both polyphenolic and curcuminoid profiles was necessary for the simultaneous characterization and classification of turmeric and curry samples. Discrimination among turmeric species such asCurcuma longavs.Curcuma zedoaria, as well as among differentCurcuma longavarieties (Alleppey, Madras and Erode) was also accomplished.

J	Gan, DJ; He, WY; Yin, HB; Gou, X				Gan, Daoju; He, Weiyang; Yin, Hubin; Gou, Xin			beta-elemene enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells through the ROS-AMPK signaling pathway	ONCOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						beta-elemene; cisplatin; apoptosis; 5 ' AMP-activated protein kinase; bladder cancer	DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; CARCINOMA CELLS; ACTIVATION; GROWTH; PROLIFERATION; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; SYSTEMS; STRESS; KINASE	Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard regimen for patients with bladder cancer, but its effectiveness is limited by high toxicity and the development of drug resistance. beta-elemene (beta-ELE), a compound extracted from Rhizoma zedoariae, has antitumor activity in various malignancies and exhibits low toxicity. However, the effects and specific mechanism of beta-ELE in bladder cancer remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor activity and possible mechanisms of beta-ELE alone and in combination with cisplatin in bladder cancer cells. Cell viability was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell cycle and reactive oxygen species (ROS) analyses were performed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 and Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by staining with a JC-1 probe, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Protein expression was detected by western blotting. The results revealed that beta-ELE significantly inhibited the proliferation of various bladder cancer cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1)-phase in T24 and 5637 cells. Compared with cisplatin alone, co-treatment with beta-ELE increased cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity against T24 cells, which resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Co-treatment with beta-ELE and cisplatin enhanced ROS accumulation and activation of 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which induced apoptosis. The results of the present study suggested that beta-ELE inhibited the proliferation of bladder cancer cells in vitro and enhanced cisplatin-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis via the ROS-AMPK signaling pathway. Combination therapy with beta-ELE requires further investigation as a potential treatment of bladder cancer.

These starches were subjected to size exclusion chromatography with refractive index detection (SEC/RI). A simple and rapid method for starch solubilisation was used. The conditions during solubilisation (2 M NaOH) and separation (10 mM NaOH, 50 degreesC) were such as enabling > 94% recovery of the starch without detectable degradation. The aggregation properties of the starch was investigated using on line refractive index/multi angle laser light scattering (RI/MALLS) detection. Three major regions in the SEC profile were identified, consisting of large amylopectin aggregates, amylopectin particles with radius of gyration (R-g) of approx 200 nm (400 nm blocklets) and amylose. A procedure for correction of light scattering signals spread over the SEC profile as a result of aggregate tailing was developed. The significance of the relative amounts of these three molecular species on standard starch pasting parameters, as measured by a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), was investigated. Starches with a high amount of amylopectin aggregates showed high peak viscosities. Moreover, very high amounts of starch bound phosphate or amylose appears to suppress the content of large aggregates resulting in low viscosity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These studies were mostly conducted in animal models in which the mechanisms of action were not yet well-established. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of hypocholesterolaemic action of 12 selected plants, namely Hibiscus sabdariffa L., Moringa oleifera Lam., Cucurbita moschata Duchesne, Ananas comosus (L.) Merr., Zingiber officinale, Morus alba L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, Piper nigrum L., Alpinia galanga (L.) Willd., Curcuma zedoaria Rose, Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. and Piper retrofractum Vahl., widely used as spices and ingredients in various types of Thai food. The extract of P. nigrum at 100 mu g mL(-1) was found to be the most effective cholesterol uptake inhibitor whereas those of A. galanga and C. sinensis effectively inhibited pancreatic lipase activity with IC50 values of 8.99 perpendicular to 3.41 and 12.36 perpendicular to 1.23 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The potency of extracts from H. sabdariffa, M. oleifera and C. moschata at 100 mu g mL (1) were found to be similar to 0.4 mu g mL(-1) pravastatin in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and possibly reduced cholesterol biosynthesis. This study also demonstrated that several of the tested plants possessed multiple sites of action that were possibly responsible for their cholesterol-lowering effect in the in vivo model.

This study aims to profile the metabolites in four Curcuma species, including C. zedoaria, C. xanthorrhiza, C. aeruginosa and C. mangga at three developmental stages (seven, eight and nine months old) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that there are metabolites changes due to the month of harvest in each of the four species. A large quantity of curcumin and demethoxycurcumin contributed to the separation of C. xanthorrhiza, whereas the diterpenoids, such as curcumanggoside, (E)-labda-8(17),12-diene-15,16-dial, calcaratarin A and zerumin B were responsible for the discrimination of C. mangga. Eight-month-old C. xanthorrhiza exhibited the highest nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity, while nine-month-old C. mangga exhibited the highest alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The correlation among the bioactivities and phytochemical constituents was determined using partial least square (PLS) analysis. Curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, germacrone, zedoarol and xanthorrhizol were correlated with the NO inhibitory activity in C. xanthorrhiza, whereas curcumanggoside, labda-8(17),12-diene-15,16-dial and zerumin B were correlated with the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity in C. mangga. From the phytochemical markers and metabolic changes among growth stages of C. xanthorrhiza and C. mangga, the biosynthetic pathway was proposed to show the metabolites that might contribute to their health benefits.

Materials: Analgesic effect was tested in ICR mice by the acetic acid-induced writhing method. Antipyretic effect was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats treated with baker's yeast. Antiinflammatory activities were tested in Wistar rats with carrageenan-induced paw edema and adjuvant-induced chronic arthritis. In vitro analyses included the capabilities to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity, and to scavenge free radicals as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Results: Oral administration of dehydrocurdione (40 to 300 mg/kg) mitigated the writhing reflex.induced by acetic acid and the fever elicited by baker's yeast. A higher dose (200 mg/kg) of dehydrocurdione was required to inhibit the carrageenan-induced paw edema. Oral administration of dehydrocurdione at 120 mg/kg/day for 12 days significantly reduced chronic adjuvant arthritis. Unlike indomethacin (IC50: 0.1 mu M), dehydrocurdione showed minimal cyclooxygenase inhibition. However, dehydrocurdione (100 mu M to 5 mM) significantly reduced free radical formation from hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron determined by EPR spectrometry using 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide as a spin trap agent. Conclusion: In addition to the well-known effect of zedoary as a stomachic, dehydrocurdione, the major component of Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe has antiinflammatory potency related to its antioxidant effect.

Recently, Curcuma rhizome-related foods with claimed health benefits have been used worldwide; however, correct identification and quality assessment have not been conducted. Due to the wide distribution and morphological similarities of Curcuma species, the classification of some species is debated and nomenclature is inconsistent among countries. In this study, to elucidate specific molecular markers of medicinally used Curcuma species in Asia, and to solve the confusion on the reported botanical origin of crude drugs, molecular analysis based on the intron length polymorphism (ILP) in genes encoding diketide-CoA synthase and curcumin synthase and the trnK intron sequences was performed using 59 plant specimens and 42 crude drug samples from 13 Curcuma species, obtained from Asian countries. The ILP patterns of the respective species from both plant specimens and crude drug samples revealed high consistency in C. aromatica, C. zedoaria, C. phaeocaulis, C. aeruginosa, C. wenyujin, and C. zanthorrhiza, but showed intraspecies polymorphism in C. longa, C. kwangsiensis, C. amada, C. mangga and C. comosa. The C. longa specimens and samples were separated into three subgroups which were highly consistent with their geographical origins. Based on the ILP markers and the trnK intron sequences, the botanical origins of "Khamin oi" from Thailand were correctly determined to be C. longa or a hybrid between C. longa and other species, and "Wan narn kum" from Thailand and "Kasturi manjal" from India were correctly determined to be C. zanthorrhiza.

Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the efficient self-emulsification regions. ZTO could serve as a partial oil phase with the aid of the second oil phase to enhance drug loading. Increasing the surfactant concentration reduced the droplet size but increased the emulsification time, while the reverse effect was observed by increasing the co-surfactant concentration. Based on the emulsification time, droplet size and zeta potential after dispersion into aqueous phase, an optimized formulation consisting of ZTO, ethyl oleate, Tween 80, transcutol P (30.8:7.7:40.5:21, w/w) and loaded with 30% drug was prepared. Upon mixing with water, the formulation was rapidly dispersed into fine droplets with a mean size of 68.3 +/- 1.6 nm and xi-potential of -41.2 +/- 1.3 mV. The active components remained stable in the optimized SNEDDS stored at 25 degrees C for at least 12 months. Following oral administration of ZTO-SNEDDS in rats, both AUC and C-max of germacrone (GM), a representative bioactive marker of ZTO, increased by 1.7-fold and 2.5-fold respectively compared with the unformulated ZTO.

Although the pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis has been extensively developed, a safer and more effective treatment is still needed. Here, we found that curcumenol (CUL), an antioxidant sesquiterpene isolated from Curcuma zedoaria, impaired receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, whereas the osteoblastogenesis of MC3T3-E1 cells was not affected. We further demonstrated that CUL treatment during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis promotes proteasomal degradation of TRAF6 by increasing its K48-linked polyubiquitination, leading to suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-kappa B pathways and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also showed that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) binds with TRAF6 to reduce its K48-linked polyubiquitination under RANKL stimulation. Concurrently, IPMK deficiency inhibits osteoclast differentiation. The binding between IPMK and TRAF6 blocked by CUL treatment was found in our study. Finally, we confirmed that CUL treatment prevented ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in mice. In summary, our study demonstrates that CUL could impair the stability of TRAF6 enhanced by IPMK and suppress excessive osteoclast activity in estrogen-deficient mice to treat osteoporosis.

The raw herbal materials, rhizomes, were collected from different regions of Thailand between December 2011 and January 2012. Six well-known Zingiberaceous plants, 16 samples from each and a total of 96 samples, were analyzed Alpinia galanga (Khaa), Boesenbergia rotunda (Kra-chaai), Curcuma longa (Khamin-chan), Curcuma zedoaria (Khamin-oi), Zingiber cassumunar (Plai) and Zingiber officinale (Ginger). Concentrations of total arsenic based on dry weight were 92.4 +/- 9.2, 103.5 +/- 20.8, 61.7 +/- 12.5, 89.8 +/- 17.5, 106.7 +/- 19.5 and 69.3 +/- 11.8 ng/g, respectively and inorganic arsenic were 48.8 +/- 7.0, 66.3 +/- 12.7, 25.5 +/- 5.0, 38.7 +/- 4.7, 71.2 +/- 11.6, and 38.5 +/- 5.5 ng/g, respectively. Among these, Plai and Kra-chaai exhibited the highest levels of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic accumulation that remind consumers to be aware of excess consuming of these rhizomes. On the contrary, the lowest value found in Khamin-chan indicating natural dietary supplements and herbal medicines comprising Kamin-chan are safe from arsenic poison. All investigated amounts of total and inorganic arsenic were much lower than limits recommended by Thai Food and Drug Administration.

Recently, both curcumin and Curcumas have become prevalent as supplement. P-gp has been reported as an important determinant for drug absorption in small intestine. In this study, Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with methanol extracts of Curcumas (0.1 mg/ml) or curcumin (30 mu M) for 72 h to investigate the relationship between the potential affects of Curcumas and curcumin on P-gp. [H-3]-digoxin and rhodamine 123 were used to evaluate P-gp activity. All Curcumas significantly increased the activity of P-gp by up-regulating the expressions of P-gp protein and MDR1 mRNA levels. Interestingly, contrary to Curcumas, curcumin treatment inhibited the activity of P-gp with a decrease in P-gp protein and MDR1 mRNA expression levels. Curcumas might alter the pharmacokinetics of co-administrated drugs by up-regulating the function and expression levels of intestinal P-gp. However, curcumin has no relationship with the inductive effect of Curcumas since curcumin showed an opposite effects. Caution should be exercised when Curcumas or curcumin are to be consumed with drugs that are P-gp substrates because Curcumas and curcumin might regulate the function of P-gp in completely opposite ways.

Elemene for the treatment of lung cancer	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							BETA-ELEMENE	Background Elemene, isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Rhizoma Zedoariae and be used to treat patients with lung cancer in China. Until now, the effects have not been systematically reviewed. Objectives The purpose of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of elemene in the treatment of patients with lung cancer. Search strategy We searched according to the strategy suggested by Lung Cancer group: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006); EMBASE (1974 to June 2006); OVID (1950 to June, 2006); CBMdisc on Chinese Biomedical Literature (Issue 1 2004 Chinese Language) and CNKI (Chinese Knowledge Internet 1994 to June 2006). Selection criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared elemene with chemotherapy agents, radiotherapy, surgery, physical therapy or other effective Chinese herb therapy, either alone or in combination, had been sought in this review, regardless of language or publication status. Data collection and analysis Two authors telephoned the original trial authors of claimed randomised controlled trials and made a decision about trial inclusion and exclusion. Main results We identified 20 trials which claimed to use random allocation. Sixteen study authors were contacted by telephone and we discovered that they misunderstood the randomisation procedure and the trials were identified as non-RCTs. We were unable to contact the authors of the remaining four studies and these have been allocated to the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to confirm or refute the effectiveness of elemene as a treatment for lung cancer. Randomised clinical trials, on elemene for the treatment of lung cancer are needed in order to define the efficacy and acceptability of elemene for lung cancer.

In treatment of various tumors including IH, beta-elemene, a compound extracted from Rhizoma zedoariae, has been reported to have anti-tumor effect. However, the underlying mechanisms of beta-elemene in hemangioma have remained uninvestigated. In this presented study, functional analysis showed that low concentrations of beta-elemene promoted the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human hemangioma endothelial cells (HemECs), while high concentrations of beta-elemene produced inhibitory effects. Further, we also found that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression was down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels, while hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1-alpha) was up-regulated in infantile hemangiomas tissues and HemECs at both mRNA and protein levels. This result suggested that ACE2 and HIF-1-alpha play roles in IH. ACE2 expression was down-regulated with the treatment of beta-elemene at different dosage point. Interestingly, the expression of Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) increased with treatment of low concentrations of beta-elemene in HemECs, in contrary, the expression of VEGFA expression decreased with treatment of high concentrations of beta-elemene. Moreover, if the concentration of beta-elemene reached 40 mu g/ml or higher, the expression of HIF-1-alpha decreased. Taken together, our data indicated that the different effects of beta-elemene on the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of hemangioma at different concentrations: The ACE2 signaling pathway dominates with treatment of low concentrations of beta-elemene, stimulating the expression of downstream VEGFA to promote the angiogenesis of hemangioma; under the condition of high concentrations of beta-elemene, the HIF-1-alpha signaling pathway inhibits the expression of VEGFA and further inhibits the angiogenesis of hemangioma.

However, the effect of beta-elemene in inflammation disorders has yet to be determined. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and potential molecular mechanisms of beta-elemene in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage cells RAW264.7. We found that the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), induced by LPS was significantly suppressed by beta-elemene in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. Also, beta-elemene inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression by RAW264.7, which was related to the down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Importantly, this study demonstrates that beta-catenin was significantly inhibited by beta-elemene, which appeared to be largely responsible for the down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Accordingly, the deletion of beta-catenin in primary macrophages reversed beta-catenin-elicited inhibition of immune response. Furthermore, beta-catenin expression and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway induced by LPS in RAW264.7 was also significantly inhibited by alpha-humulene, one isomeric sesquiterpene of beta-elemene. alpha-humulene was also found to significantly inhibit LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, alpha-humulene showed more cytotoxic ability than beta-elemene. Collectively, our data illustrated that beta-elemene exerted a potent inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory meditator and cytokines production via the inactivation of beta-catenin, and also demonstrated the protective functions of beta-elemene in endotoxin-induced inflammation. beta-elemene may serve as potential nontoxic modulatory agents for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Aqueous extracts from plants were investigated for their inhibitory effects on the binding of anti-cobra venom antibody to antigen, cobra venom, fixed onto 96-well microtiter plates. Ingredients in extracts were allowed to react with immobilized venom before the Subsequent addition of antivenom antibody. Venom components affected by exposure to the extracts, unable to interact with their specific antibody, were predicted to be unable to bind to their native destinations or natural receptors. Curcuma cf. zedoaria, an old Thai medicinal plant, showed clear inhibitory activity in the ELISA test. Neurotoxin and protein degradative enzymes, major components in venom, were identified as targets of this extract in Western immunoblotting analysis. Ingredients in the extract showed high affinity to the toxin in competition assay by immunoprecipitation. The extract attenuated toxin activity by extending contraction time of diaphragm muscle after envenomation and had a potency to protect cellular proteins from venom degradative enzymes. Curcuma parviflora, with less activity in ELISA, exhibited acceptable results in two experiments but negative results in two experiments, whereas Curcuma longa, having low activity in the ELISA test, never showed any favorable results. Screening of 36 samples could classify plants into ail inhibition range of 0 to 86%. This modified ELISA is recommended as a preliminary screening method for inhibitors with a large number of samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These plants emit characteristic fragrances and are used for traditional foods and folk medicines. From their fragrant tissues, i.e., sprouts of Araliaceae plants and developing rhizomes of zedoary, total RNAs were extracted and reverse transcribed. The resultant cDNAs were used for degenerate PCR followed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. From the contig sequences obtained, full-length Tps genes were amplified by PCR with newly synthesized primer sets. The isolated full-length genes were introduced into engineered Escherichia coli cells, which can utilize acetoacetate to synthesize farnesyl diphosphate, the substrate for TPSs, through the mevalonate pathway. TPS products synthesized in the transformed E. coli cells were analysed by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and optical rotation. Consequently, the isolated Tps genes were found to encode beta-caryophyllene synthase, germacrene D synthase, linalool/(3S)-(+)-nerolidol synthase, beta-eudesmol synthase, and germacrene B synthase. These results lead us to expect that some of the effective ingredients in folk medicines are volatile terpenes and that intake of traditional foods including these edible plants would have some positive effects on our health.

Investigation into the mechanism of the Topoisomerase II (Top2) poison of these plants may give rise to new drug leads for cancer treatment. Aim of the study: This study aimed to screen ethnomedicinal plants used in Thai traditional medicine for Top2 poison activity using a yeast cell-based assay and also to validate the traditional uses of these plants by examining the Top2 poison activity. Materials and methods: Thirty Thai medicinal plants were harvested and identified. Plant methanol extracts were prepared and screened in vitro using a yeast cell-based assay. Mutant yeast strains carrying the top2-1 allele, which encodes a temperature-sensitive topoisomerase, were used to establish the yeast spot test. Strains carrying this mutation grow normally at 25 degrees C and generally have a wild-type drug sensitivity. These yeast strains are able to grow at 30 degrees C, but the Top2 activity is greatly reduced at this temperature, which causes the strains to be highly drug resistant to anti-Top2 agents. Cell growth was measured by colony survival after exposure to various concentrations of extracts at different temperatures. Results: The extracts of six out of thirty ethnomedicinal plants, Curcuma longa, C. zedoaria, Derris scandens, Grangea maderaspatana, Stephania pierrei and S. suberosa, were found to have Top2 poison activity against the yeast cells. Conclusions: The yeast screening system confirmed the proposed anti-cancer mechanisms of plants used in Thai traditional medicine by traditional doctors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, its preventive role in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and the mechanisms of action of beta-elemene on CCA need to be further investigated. MethodsA thioacetamide (TAA)-induced pre-CCA animal model was well-established, and a low dosage of beta-elemene was intragastrically (i.g.) administered for 6 months. Livers were harvested and examined histologically by a deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN). cDNA array was used to analyze the genetic changes of CCA cells following beta-elemene treatment. Immunohistochemical methods were applied to detect beta-elemene-targeted protein PCDH9 in CCA specimens, and its predictive role was analyzed. beta-Elemene treatment at the cellular or animal level was performed to test the effect of this traditional Chinese medicine on CCA cells. ResultsIn the rat model of pre-CCA, the ratio of cholangiolar proliferation lesions was 0.98% +/- 0.72% in the control group, significantly higher than that of the beta-elemene (0. 47% +/- 0.30%) groups (p = 0.0471). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the top 10 pathways affected by beta-elemene treatment were associated with energy metabolism, and one was associated with the cell cycle. beta-Elemene inactivated a number of oncogenes and restored the expression of multiple tumor suppressors. PCDH9 is a target of beta-elemene and displays an important role in predicting tumor recurrence in CCA patients. ConclusionsThese findings proved that long-term use of beta-elemene has the potential to interrupt the progression of CCA and improve the life quality of rats. Moreover, beta-elemene exerted its anticancer potential partially by restoring the expression of PCDH9.

Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) is proven to be a key molecule in the inflammatory signaling network. By using microglial cell line BV-2 and a mouse model of cecal ligation puncture (CLP), we herein evaluated the effects of beta-elemene, an extract of Curcuma zedoaria Rosc., on RAC1 signaling in microglia. beta-Elemene decreased the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6] and attenuated translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus in BV-2 cells after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. It also inhibited the activation of RAC1, mixed-lineage protein kinase 3 (MLK3) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The phosphorylation of the RAC1 Ser71 site was increased by beta-elemene. Moreover, the learning and memory abilities of CLP mice in the water maze test and fear conditioning test were improved after beta-elemene treatment. It reduced the expression of the microglial marker IBA1, significantly increased RAC1 Ser71 phosphorylation, and suppressed the RAC1/MLK3/p38 signaling activation and inflammatory response in the hippocampus. In conclusion, beta-elemene effectively alleviated SAE in mice and inhibited the RAC1/MLK3/p38 signaling pathway in microglia, and might be an eligible potential candidate for SAE treatment.

Epidemiological studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Clinical trials of lipid lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor have been shown to decrease coronary events and mortality. Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural antioxidants occurring in natural products such as traditional Chinese herbs, fruits and beverages such as tea and wine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of crude extracts from traditional Chinese herbs on HMG Co-A reductase. The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have been well-established by using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Crude extracts from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in 1% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate for 24 hours in order to observe cell growth. Pravastatin, a specific HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, was used as a positive control which inhibits Vero cells growth effectively and cell growth inhibition was reversible after I mM mevalonate. Among 100 traditional Chinese herbs used for the study, only two herbs: Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe and Poncirus trifoliata Raf. showed significant growth inhibition of Vero cells. This study shows that some crude extracts isolated from traditional medicinal herbs were effective HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors which might be developed into new hypocholesterolemic agents.

Despite considerable efforts made in recent years, the prognosis of patients with liver cancer remains poor. Curcuma zedoaria (known as Ezhu in Chinese) is widely prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine. Germacrone (GM) is a sesquiterpene constituent derived from the essential oil of Ezhu, and exerts anti-carcinogenic effects by inducing apoptosis in various cancer cells. The present study investigated the potential mechanism of GM in HepG2 cells. Cell Counting Kit-8, colony-formation and lactate dehydrogenase-release assays, as well as cell death assays using flow cytometry, were performed to evaluate HepG2 cell proliferation following GM treatment. HepG2 cells were transfected with caspase-3 small interfering RNA and then treated with GM. Caspase-3 expression levels were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. The present study showed that GM inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells and induced the proteolytic cleavage of caspase 3, with concomitant cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME), by markedly increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This led to caspase 3-dependent cleavage of GSDME, thereby promoting pyroptosis in HepG2 cells. However, these changes were rescued by ROS scavengers, such as N-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, GM inhibited tumor growth by promoting the cleavage of caspase 3 and GSDME in HepG2 cell xenograft models. These results indicated that GM induced GSDME-dependent pyroptosis through caspase 3 activation, at least in part, by damaging the mitochondria and enhancing ROS production, thereby supporting the possible development of GM as a candidate for the prevention and treatment of liver cancer.

J	Wu, JF; Tang, DC				Wu, Jiafei; Tang, Decai			The Effect and Related Mechanism of Action of Astragalus Compatible with Curcumin against Colon Cancer Metastasis in Mice	GASTROENTEROLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							IN-VIVO; EXTRACT; VITRO; ZEDOARIA; TUMOR	Colon cancer (CC) is the third most common tumor worldwide. Colon carcinogenesis is strongly linked to inflammation. The initiation and progression of colon cancer may be influenced by epigenetic processes. Cancer metastasis is a multistep process involving several genes and their products. During tumor metastasis, cancer cells first enhance their proliferative capacity by lowering autophagy and apoptosis, and then, their capacity is stimulated by boosting tumors' ability to take nutrients from the outside via angiogenesis. Traditional treatment focuses on eliminating tumor cells by triggering cell death or activating the immune system, which often results in side effects or chemoresistance recurrence. On the contrary, Chinese medicine theory considers the patient's entire inner system and aids in tumor shrinkage while also taking into account the mouse' general health. Because many Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) are consumed as food, using edible CHMs as a diet resource therapy for colon cancer treatment is a viable option. Two traditional Chinese herbs, Astragalus membranaceus and Curcuma zedoaria, are commonly utilized jointly in colon cancer preventive therapy. As a result, the anticancer effect of astragalus and curcumin (AC) on colon cancer suppression in an 18-week AOM-DSS colon cancer mouse model is investigated in this research. These findings may offer a scientific foundation for investigating colon cancer diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic application of AC in colon cancer treatment. These studies also highlighted the potential effect and mechanism of AC in the treatment of colon cancer, as well as providing insight into how to effectively use it.

Zedoary turmeric oil (ZTO), the steam extract of Curcuma zedoaria Rosc was researched for its chemical composition, antibacterial activity, and mechanism for countering two major food-borne pathogenic species, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Methodology. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse and characterize the chemical composition of ZTO. Its MICs for the two bacterial species and growth curves were measured. Western blot and real-time reversetranscription (RT)-PCR assays were utilized to elaborate the mechanism of the antibacterial effect of ZTO by examining the expression levels of virulence-related extracellular proteins. ELISA was used to explore the biological relevance. Results. GC-MS revealed high contents of curzerene, eucalyptol, germacrone and (-)-g-elemene representing 28.45, 10.94, 10.77 and 10.54 %, respectively, of the whole components. The MICs of ZTO that combatted L. monocytogenes and S. aureus were similar (1-2 mg ml(-1)). After adding ZTO at increasing concentrations, there was an evident reduction in the transcription of hly, iap, hla, sea, seb and agrA in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, TNF-alpha accumulation in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by L. monocytogenes and S. aureus supernatants was restricted by a 1/4 MIC of ZTO. Conclusion. Overall, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus were comparably susceptible to ZTO. These data demonstrated that ZTO's antimicrobial property was mediated by the repression of the production of virulence factors involved in L. monocytogenes and S. aureus pathogenesis, a finding that can potentially further progress in the development of new anti-virulence drugs.

Its main components include curcumol and curcumin, which have anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis effects. Here we established an in vitro inflammatory injury model by stimulating RAW246.7 cells with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and detected the intervention effects of curcumin and curcumol on CSE-treated Raw246.7 macrophage cells to explore whether the two compounds inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the NF kappa B signaling pathway. We detected the antifibrosis effects of curcumin and curcumol via TGF-beta(1)/Smads signaling pathways. The model of macrophage damage group was established by CSE stimulation. Curcumol and curcumin were administered to Raw246.7 macrophage cells. The efficacy of curcumol and curcumin was evaluated by comparing the activation of proinflammatory factors, profibrotic factors, and NF-kappa B and TGF-beta(1)/Smads signaling pathway. In addition, CSE-treated group was employed to detect whether the efficacy of curcumol and curcumin was dependent on the NF-kappa B signaling via the pretreatment with the inhibitor of NF-kappa B. Our findings demonstrated that curcumol and curcumin could reduce the release of intracellular ROS from macrophages, inhibit the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and downregulatc the release of proinflammatory factor. Curcumol and curcumin inhibited the TGF-beta(1)/Smads signaling pathway and downregulated the release of fibrotic factors. Curcumin showed no anti-inflammatory effect in CSE-treated cells after the inhibition of NF-kappa B. Curcumol and curcumin showed an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

Methods: The herbs studied were Alpinia galanga, Curcuma longa, Curcuma zedoaria, Mentha cordifolia, Ocimum africanum, Ocimum basilicum, Ocimum sanctum, Piper betle, Piper chaba, Piper nigrum, Piper sarmentosum and Zingiber officinale. Various Candida spp. were examined for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) using microdilution method; time-kill assay was also used to assess the plants. Antibiofilm activity was investigated using a 3-[4, 5-dimethyl- 2-thiazolyl]-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium-bromide (MTT assay). Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, thin layer chromatography (TLC) fingerprinting and TLC-bioautography were used to determine the active anticandidal compounds. Results: All tested herbs, except extracts of P. nigrum and Limiaceae family, showed varying zones of inhibition against Candida albicans ATCC 90028. P. betle revealed the strongest anticandidal activity against all tested strains with MIC ranging from 1.56 to 3.13 mg/ml, and MFC from 3.13 to 8.33 mg/ml. Killing activity depended on time and concentrations of the extract. The concentration of P. betle extract required to inhibit >= 90 % biofilm formation of C. albicans ATCC 90028 was 3.13 +/- 0.15 mg/ml, while that to remove >= 90 % biofilm growth was 12.50 +/- 0.69 mg/ml. The result of GC-MS analysis showed the major compound of P. betle extract responsible for anticandidal activity as 4-chromanol. Conclusion: P. betle extract contains 4-chromanol which is a good potential anticandidal agent for the treatment of oral infectious diseases caused by certain Candida spp.	[Kawsud, Pajaree; Teanpaisan, Rawee] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Dent, Common Oral Dis & Epidemiol Res Ctr, Hat Yai 90112, Thailand; [Kawsud, Pajaree; Teanpaisan, Rawee] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Stomatol, Hat Yai 90112, Thailand; [Puripattanavong, Jindaporn] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmacognosy & Pharmaceut Bot, Hat Yai 90112, Thailand		Teanpaisan, R (autor correspondente), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Dent, Common Oral Dis & Epidemiol Res Ctr, Hat Yai 90112, Thailand.	rawee.t@psu.ac.th	Puripattanavong, Jindaporn/AAW-1175-2020		Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission [DEN5405475]	Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission	This work was supported by the Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission (DEN5405475).		22	11	11	0	18	PHARMACOTHERAPY GROUP	BENIN CITY	UNIV BENIN, FACULTY PHARMACY, BENIN CITY, 00000, NIGERIA	1596-5996			TROP J PHARM RES	Trop.

Recent studies show that beta-ELE reverses the drug resistance of tumor cells. To explore the possible mechanisms of beta-ELE, we investigated its effects on cisplatin (DDP)-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma A549/DDP cells. Methods: The effects of beta-ELE on the growth of A549/DDP cells in vitro were determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33258 staining, flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/propium iodide double staining; mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1 fluorescence probe and laser confocal scanning microscopy, and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured by 2',7'-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate staining and flow cytometry; and contents of cytosolic glutathione were determined by glutathione assay kits. Intracellular Rhodamine-123 fluorescence intensity was detected by flow cytometry, and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was detected by Western blotting. Results: beta-ELE inhibited the proliferation of A549/DDP cells in a time-and dosedependent manner. Furthermore, beta-ELE enhanced the sensitivity of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin and reversed the drug resistance of A549/DDP cells. Consistent with a role in activating apoptosis, beta-ELE decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species concentration and intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123, decreased the cytoplasmic glutathione levels and the expression of P-gp in a time-and dose-dependent manner.

Materials and Methods: Antimycobacterial activity test was carried out against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Chemical profiling of secondary metabolite using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and High Resolution-Mass Spectroscopy (HR-MS) was done to the ethyl acetate extract of active strain InaCC A758. Molecular taxonomy analysis based on 16S rRNA gene and biosynthetic gene clusters analysis of polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) from InaCC A758 have been carried out. Bioassay guided isolation of ethyl acetate extract was done, then structural elucidation of active compound was performed using UV-Vis, FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopy methods. Results: The chemical profiling using HR-MS revealed that InaCC A758 has the potential to produce new antimycobacterial compounds. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that InaCC A758 has the closest homology to Streptomyces parvus strain NBRC 14599 (99.64%). In addition, InaCC A758 has NRPS gene and related to S. parvulus (92% of similarity), and also PKS gene related to PIGS-type borrelidin of S. rochei and S. parvulus (74% of similarity). Two compounds with potential antimycobacterial were predicted as 1) Compound 1, similar to dimethenamid (C12H18ClNO2S; MW 275.0723), with MIC value of 100 mu g/ml, and 2) Compound 2, actinomycin D (C(6)2H(86)N(12)O(16); MW 1254.6285), with MIC value of 0.78 mu g/ml. Conclusion: Actinomycin D has been reported to have antimycobacterial activity, however the compound has been predicted to resemble dimethenamid had not been reported to have similar activity.

Two populations of Aedes aegypti, the laboratory and natural field strains, collected in Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand were tested in pyrethroid-susceptibility bioassays. The results revealed that the natural field strain of A. aegypti was resistant to permethrin, with mortality rates ranging from 51 to 66%. A mild susceptibility, with mortality rates ranging from 82 to 88%, was observed in the natural field strain of A. aegypti exposed to lambdacyhalothrin, which suggested that this strain was tolerant and might be resistant to this insecticide. However, laboratory-reared A. aegypti exposed to discriminating dosages of permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin induced 100% mortality in all cases, thus indicating complete susceptibility of this strain to these insecticides. The adulticidal activity determined by topical application revealed that all five essential oils exerted a promising adulticidal efficacy against both laboratory and natural field strains of A. aegypti. Although the laboratory strain was slightly more susceptible to these essential oils than the natural field strain, no statistically significant difference was observed. Moreover, comparison of the adulticidal activity indicated that the performance of these essential oils against the two strains of A. aegypti was similar. The highest potential was established from caraway, followed by zedoary, celery, long pepper, and Chinese star anise, with an LC50 in the laboratory strain of 5.44, 5.94, 5.96, 6.21, and 8.52 mu g/mg female, respectively, and 5.54, 6.02, 6.14, 6.35, and 8.83 mu g/mg female, respectively, in the field strain. These promising essential oils are, therefore, an alternative in developing and producing mosquito adulticides as an effective measure used in controlling and eradicating mosquito vectors.

It has long been known for their uses as folk medicines, foods, spices, and cosmetics. However, the identification of plants in the genus Curcuma is very difficult due to morphological similarity in the early flowering stage. Recently, the molecular technique is one of the reliable and powerful tools for plant identification. In this study, the genetic relationship among twenty Curcuma species from Thailand was accessed by the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method. AFLP fingerprint showed 98.54% highly polymorphisms with the number of bands (617 bands) ranging between 48 and 80 bands. The dendrogram generated from the unweighted pair group method of the arithmetic average could separate these Curcuma species into three major clusters. Cluster I can be subdivided into IA, which composed of Curcuma parviflora, Curcuma sparganiifolia, Curcuma alismatifolia, Curcuma larsenii, Curcuma Gracillima, and Curcuma rhabdota with similarity index (SI) 0.7926-0.9358 and IB composed of Curcuma petiolata and Curcuma rubrobracteata with the SI 0.9240. Cluster II can be subdivided into IIA being composed of Curcuma longa, Curcuma Zedoaria, and Curcuma aromatica with the SI 0.8989-0.9071, whereas Cluster IIB was composed of Curcuma leucorrhiza, Curcuma aeruginosa, Curcuma comosa, Curcuma mangga, Curcuma angustifolia, Curcuma amada, Curcuma sessilis, and Curcuma albicoma with the SI 0.8236-0.9500. Cluster III belongs to Curcuma singularis and Alpinia galanga (outgroup plant), which clearly separated into different clusters from twenty Curcuma species. In summary, the ten successful AFLP primer combinations could be used to determine the genetic relationship among closely related twenty Curcuma species in Thailand.

Nutrient and metal analyses of Chinese herbal products marketed for veterinary use	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION			English	Article						herbs; dogs; horses; mineral; supplement; Yunnan Baiyao	TRACE-ELEMENTS; MINERAL-CONTENT; DOGS; MEDICINE; DRUGS; FOODS; CATS	Many Chinese herbs and herbal mixtures are fed to domestic animals for their reputed medicinal properties. These herbs could contribute to the intake of essential nutrients and toxic metals, but their composition is mostly unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure major nutrient (crude protein, crude fat, carbohydrate, fibre) and mineral (Ca, P, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Mo, S, Al, Cd, Ni, Pb) concentrations in samples of fourteen combination formulas labelled for veterinary use and commonly administered to horses and dogs. Three single herbs, Bupleurum chinense, Curcuma zedoaria and Astragalus membranaceus, each obtained from several sources, and Yunnan Baiyao, a proprietary hemostatic mixture, were also analysed. Proximate analyses and some mineral concentrations differed (p<0.05) among single herbs, and high concentrations of several minerals were detected in some herbal combinations. Those containing the highest concentrations [g/kg dry matter (DM)] of calcium (92.4), iron (2.6) and manganese (0.28) could provide >38%, 142% and 96%, respectively, of recommended allowances in adult dogs, and >13%, 122% and 2%, respectively, of maintenance requirements in horses, at the maximum labelled dose assuming complete availability. Concentrations of cadmium, nickel and lead were below published oral tolerance levels. Aluminium concentrations (median 380, maximum 920mg/kg DM) were higher than has been previously reported in Chinese herbs. These nutrient analyses suggest that herbal combinations marketed to veterinarians, when fed at the maximal labelled dose, are unlikely to produce clinically relevant changes in the dietary intake of essential nutrients. However, small amounts of non-essential contaminant minerals are present in some formulas, and further research is necessary to understand the significance of this finding.	[Shmalberg, J.; Hill, R.

As a potential natural herbal medicine, white turmeric rhizome has antioxidant properties that potentially protect the body from copper pollution. This study aimed to explore the potential of the white turmeric rhizome (Curcuma zedoaria) to provide a protective effect on the lungs against copper contamination. This study was an experimental study performed in June 2020 on 25 copper-induced Wistar rats which were divided into five groups: negative group that received 1 mL of copper sulfate suspension at the 12th to 14th day; positive group that received 10 mg/200 gBW of ethanol extract from white turmeric without copper sulfate suspension; and three experimental groups that received 10 mg/200gBW, 20 mg/200 gBW, and 40 mg/200 gBW of ethanol extract from white turmeric every day, respectively, followed by copper sulfate suspension at the 12th-14th day. After 14 days, the rats were sacrificed by chloroform inhalation and the lung was excised and processed for histopathology preparation. The edema, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, and alveolar septal thickness were evaluated from the lung tissue perparation. The score of tissue damage was express as median (range) and analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The result of this study shows that there was a significant difference in lung tissue score among all groups of treatment (p-value=0.001). The experimental group with highest dosage extract presented a good protection effect as well as the positive group. Hence, white turmeric has a good protective property for the lung against damages caused by copper contamination.

There have been many scientific studies on their immunomodulating effects to support their ethnopharmacological uses. In this review, the efficacy of six Curcuma species, namely, C. longa L., C. zanthorrhiza Roxb., C. mangga Valeton & Zijp, C. aeruginosa Roxb. C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe, and C. amada Roxb., and their bioactive metabolites to modulate the immune system, their mechanistic effects, and their potential to be developed into effective and safe immunomodulatory agents are highlighted. Literature search has been carried out extensively to gather significant findings on immunomodulating activities of these plants. The immunomodulatory effects of Curcuma species were critically analyzed, and future research strategies and appropriate perspectives on the plants as source of new immunomodulators were discussed. Most of the pharmacological investigations to evaluate their immunomodulatory effects were in vivo and in vitro experiments on the crude extracts of the plants. The extracts were not chemically characterized or standardized. Of all the Curcuma species investigated, the immunomodulatory effects of C. longa were the most studied. Most of the bioactive metabolites responsible for the immunomodulating activities were not determined, and mechanistic studies to understand the underlying mechanisms were scanty. There are limited clinical studies to confirm their efficacy in human. Of all the bioactive metabolites, only curcumin is undergoing extensive clinical trials based on its anti-inflammatory properties and main use as an adjuvant for the treatment of cancer. More in-depth studies to understand the underlying mechanisms using experimental in vivo animal models of immune-related disorders and elaborate bioavailability, preclinical pharmacokinetics, and toxicity studies are required before clinical trials can be pursued for development into immunomodulatory agents.

The essential oils (EOs) of Curcuma species possess a wide variety of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anticancerous, antiproliferative, hypocholesterolemic, antidiabetic, antirheumatic, hypotensive, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, antithrombotic, antityrosinase, and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitory activities, among others. Curcuma oils are also known to enhance immune function, promote blood circulation, accelerate toxin elimination, and stimulate digestion. C. longa (turmeric) and C. zedoaria (zedoary) are the most extensively studied species of Curcuma due to their high commercial value. There is some interest in expanding the cultivation of Curcuma species to the southern regions in North America where the climate is favorable. The purpose of this work was to examine the rhizome essential oil composition of four species of Curcuma (C. aromatica, C. caesia, C. longa, C. zanthorrhiza) that were obtained from Vietnam and cultivated in North Alabama. The rhizome essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques. The essential oils of C. aromatica were dominated by curzerenone (14.7-18.6%), germacrone (10.7-14.7%), 1,8-cineole (5.2-11.7%), and an unidentified component (8.7-11.0%). The major components in C. longa rhizome oil were ar-turmerone (8.3-36.1%), alpha-turmerone (12.7-15.2%), beta-turmerone (5.0-15.4%), alpha-zingiberene (4.6-13.9%), and beta-sesquiphellandrene (4.6-10.0%). The essential oils of C. caesia and C. zanthorrhiza were rich in curzerenone, curdione, and germacrone. These adapted turmeric varieties in North Alabama have potential use for medical purposes and medicinal plant oil market demands in the U.S.	[Duong, Lam; Mentreddy, Srinivasa Rao] Alabama A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Normal, AL 35762 USA; [Satyal, Rakesh] Analyt Res Ctr, Kritipur 44660, Nepal; [Satyal, Prabodh; Setzer, William N.] Aromat Plant Res Ctr, 230 N 1200 E Suite 100, Lehi, UT 84043 USA; [Setzer, William N.] Univ Alabama, Dept Chem, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA		Mentreddy, SR (autor correspondente), Alabama A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Normal, AL 35762 USA.; Setzer, WN (autor correspondente), Aromat Plant Res Ctr, 230 N 1200 E Suite 100, Lehi, UT 84043 USA.; Setzer, WN (autor correspondente), Univ Alabama, Dept Chem, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.	lamduongvn@gmail.com; srinivasa.mentreddy@aamu.edu; rsatyal@aromaticplant.org; psatyal@aromaticplant.org; wsetzer@chemistry.uah.edu		Setzer, William N./0000-0002-3639-0528; Duong, Lam/0000-0002-6121-5713					36	1	1	4	4	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2311-7524		HORTICULTURAE	Horticulturae	MAY	2022	8	5							360	10.3390/horticulturae8050360	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae8050360			18	Horticulture	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Agriculture	1O5HZ		gold			2022-09-29	WOS:000801364500001

In this study, we compared the tyrosinase inhibitory properties of four Curcuma spp., namely, C. xanthorrhiza, C. aromatica, C. amada, and C. zedoaria. Bioassay-guided isolation and purification of tyrosinase inhibitors using silica gel column and high-performance liquid chromatography. Structural identification of the compounds was conducted using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. C. amada showed the highest tyrosinase inhibitory activity, with an IC50 of 53.4 mu g/mL. Therefore, it was chosen for the isolation and purification of tyrosinase inhibitors. The purified compounds were zederone (1), furanodienone (2), 1,5-epoxy-3-hydroxy- 1-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl) heptanes (3), 3,5-dihydroxy-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxy-3- methoxyphenyl) heptanes (4) and 1,5-epoxy-3-hydroxy-1-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) heptanes (5). The IC50 values for the mushroom anti-tyrosinase activity of compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 108.2, 89.2, 92.3, 21.7, and 41.3 mu M, respectively. These compounds also inhibited intracellular tyrosinase activity, thus reducing melanin synthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. Compound 4 showed significantly stronger anti-tyrosinase activity than that of arbutin (a positive control drug). No significant difference was observed in the tyrosinase inhibitory effect between compound 5 and arbutin. Our findings strongly suggest that C. amada is a promising source of natural tyrosinase inhibitors to prevent melanogenesis and could be used as a whitening cosmetic.

Therefore there is a need for new antimalarial drugs. Medicinal plants have always been the major source for the search of new antimalarial drugs. The aim of this study was to screen selected Malaysian medicinal plants for their antiplasmodial properties. Methods: Each part of the plants were processed, defatted by hexane and sequentially extracted with dichloromethane, methanol and water. The antiplasmodial activities of 54 plant extracts from 14 species were determined by Plasmodium falciparum Histidine Rich Protein II ELISA technique. In order to determine the selectivity index (SI), all plant extracts demonstrating a good antiplasmodial activity were tested for their cytotoxicity activity against normal Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell lines by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: Twenty three extracts derived from Curcuma zedoaria (rhizome), Curcuma aeruginosa (rhizome), Alpinia galanga (rhizome), Morinda elliptica (leaf), Curcuma mangga (rhizome), Elephantopus scaber (leaf), Vitex negundo (leaf), Brucea javanica (leaf, root and seed), Annona muricata (leaf), Cinnamomun iners (leaf) and Vernonia amygdalina (leaf) showed promising antiplasmodial activities against the blood stage chloroquine resistant P. falciparum (EC50 < 10 mu g/ ml) with negligible toxicity effect to MDBK cells in vitro (SI >= 10). Conclusion: The extracts belonging to eleven plant species were able to perturb the growth of chloroquine resistant P. falciparum effectively. The findings justified the bioassay guided fractionation on these plants for the search of potent antimalarial compounds or formulation of standardized extracts which may enhance the antimalarial effect in vitro and in vivo.

Jian-Gan-Xiao-Zhi decoction (JGXZ), composed of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Panax notoginseng, Curcuma zedoaria, and other 9 types of herbs, has demonstrated beneficial effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanisms behind JGXZ's impact on NAFLD remain unknown. Methods. In this study, a NAFLD rat model induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) received oral treatment of JGXZ (8 or 16g crude herb/kg) for 12 weeks. The therapeutic effects of JGXZ on NAFLD model rats were investigated through blood lipid levels and pathological liver changes. 16S rRNA analysis was used to study the changes in gut microbiota after JGXZ treatment. The expressions of occludin and tight junction protein 1 (ZO-1) in the colon were investigated using immunostaining to study the effects of JGXZ on gut permeability. The anti-inflammatory effects of JGXZ were also studied through measuring the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the serum and liver. Results. JGXZ treatment could decrease body weight and ameliorate dyslipidemia in NAFLD model rats. H&E and Oil Red 0 staining indicated that JGXZ reduced steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver. 16S rRNA analysis showed that JGXZ impacted the diversity of gut microbiota, decreasing the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and increasing the relative abundance of probiotics, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus, and Turicibacter. Gut permeability evaluation found that the expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in the colon were increased after JGXZ treatment. Moreover, JGXZ treatment could decrease the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the serum and liver. Conclusions. Our study illustrated that JGXZ could ameliorate NAFLD through modulating gut microbiota, decreasing gut permeability, and alleviating inflammatory response.

Roscoe), and temu lawak (Curcuma zanthorriza Roxb.). Maceration method with ethanol as the solvent was used for extraction. The eluent used for fingerprint by TLC was chloroform: dichloromethane (9:1v/v). Five accessions of temu hitam show similar fingerprint patterns, but different in band thickness. Temu hitam rhizomes have bands of curcuminoid (Rf 0.22, 0.10, 0.03), and characteristic bands of Rf 0.42, 0.27, and 0.77, which can be distinguished from turmeric and temu lawak and Rf 0.13, which is different from temu putih. Leaves and stems of temu hitam can be distinguished from temu putih, turmeric, and temu lawak at Rf 0.60. Rhizomes of all plants reveal strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and antioxidant activity on DPPH radicals than its corresponding stems and leaves. Antibacterial and antioxidant activities were determined by microdilution and TLC-bioautography. Antibacterial activity of rhizomes of Cirebon and Kuningan 1 accessions are higher than that of other accessions (MIC=250 mu g/mL; MBC=500 mu g/mL, but lower as compared to that of temu lawak (MIC=62.5 mu g/mL, MBC=250 mu g/mL) and tetracycline (MIC=MBC=15.63 mu g/mL). Rhizome of Liwa accession exhibits the highest antioxidant activity (IC50=124.88 mu g/mL) amongst all accessions, but lower than that of temu lawak (IC50=18.45 mu g/mL), turmeric (IC50=18.82 mu g/mL), and temu putih (IC50=94.35 mu g/mL).

Recent studies have demonstrated that -ELE can reverse the drug resistance of tumor cells. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports concerning the reversal of erlotinib resistance by -ELE in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of -ELE on erlotinib-resistant human NSCLC A549/ER cells in vitro and its possible mechanism of action. The sensitivity of A549/ER cells to erlotinib, the cytotoxicity of -ELE on the growth of A549/ER cells and the effects of -ELE on the reversal of drug resistance in A549/ER cells were determined by MTT assay. The cell apoptosis rate, cell cycle phase distribution and intracellular rhodamine 123 (Rh123) fluorescence intensity were detected by flow cytometry. The expression level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was detected by western blotting. A549/ER cells had a stable drug-resistance to erlotinib. -ELE inhibited the proliferation of A549/ER cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, enhanced the sensitivity of A549/ER cells to erlotinib and reversed the drug resistance in A549/ER cells. Treatment with 15 mu g/ml -ELE combined with 10 mu mol/l erlotinib caused an increased rate of cell apoptosis and G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. Furthermore, -ELE reduced the efflux of Rh123 from A549/ER cells, increased the intracellular accumulation of Rh123 and decreased the expression of P-gp. The results of the present study indicated that -ELE could reverse drug resistance in erlotinib-resistant human NSCLC A549/ER cells in vitro through a mechanism that may involve the decreased expression of P-gp, inhibition of P-gp dependent drug efflux and the increased intracellular concentration of anticancer drugs.

Recent studies have demonstrated that beta-ELE reverses the drug resistance of tumor cells. To explore the possible mechanisms of action of beta-ELE, we investigated its effects on cisplatin-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma A549/DDP cells. The effects of beta-ELE on the growth of A549/DDP cells in vitro were determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using JC-1 fluorescence probe and laser confocal scanning microscopy, and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate staining and flow cytometry. Cytosolic glutathione content was determined using GSH kits. The expression of cytochrome c, caspase-3, procaspase-3 and the Bcl-2 family proteins was assessed by western blotting. The results demonstrated that beta-ELE inhibited the proliferation of A549/DDP cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, beta-ELE enhanced the sensitivity of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin and reversed the drug resistance of A549/DDP cells. Consistent with a role in activating apoptosis, beta-ELE decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species concentration and decreased the cytoplasmic glutathione levels in a time-and dose-dependent manner. The combination of beta-ELE and cisplatin enhanced the protein expression of cytochrome c, caspase-3 and Bad, and reduced protein levels of Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 in the A549/DDP lung cancer cells. These results define a pathway of procaspase-3-beta-ELE function that involves decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to apoptosis triggered by the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and the modulation of apoptosis-related genes. The reversal of drug resistance of the A549/DDP cell line by beta-ELE may be derived from its effect in inducing apoptosis.

The successful inclusion of white turmeric into the chitosan matrix is confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Due to the presence of hydrogen bonding interaction, the active films exhibited good tensile properties, smooth surface morphology, miscibility, water resistance and UV barrier properties. The incorporation of white turmeric reduced the water vapour transmission rate and oxygen permeability (p < 0.05) in contrast with pristine film. The prepared blend films revealed soil degradation rate more than 60% within 15 days. Furthermore, the blend films exhibited lesser water solubility, moisture content and swelling index after addition of white turmeric to chitosan (p < 0.05). The prepared films revealed extensive antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content were improved upon the incorporation of white turmeric. Moreover, the oil absorption rate of the blend films was decreased by 46% in comparison with pristine film. Overall, white turmeric incorporated chitosan films were employed as a green packaging material to extend the shelf life of the foodstuff.

Larvicidal efficacy against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes of zedoary oil and its formulated preparation, zedoary oil-impregnated sand granules, were investigated and compared with that of Abate (R) sand (temephos). Zedoary oil exhibited pronounced potential against the fourth instar larvae of A. aegypti with an LC50 and LC99 of 33.45 and 83.39 ppm, respectively. Application of zedoary oil at a dosage yielding ten times that of LC99 offered complete larval mortality (100% mortality) for a period of 3 days, and the larval mortality subsequently decreased to lower than 50% after application for more than 5 days. Zedoary oil-impregnated sand granules provided remarkably longer activity, with a larval mortality of 100% for a period of 9 days; and mortality below 50% was obtained in week 3 of application. The complete larval mortality that resulted from applying temephos at dosages of 0.1 and 1 ppm persisted for a period of 6 days and 4 weeks, respectively, and the larval mortality below 50% was reported on day 18 and week 11, respectively. Testing A. aegypti species against stored samples of zedoary oil-impregnated sand granules demonstrated that the product stored at 4 degrees C showed the longest larvicidal activity, followed by those kept at ambient temperature and 45 degrees C, yielding a complete larval mortality for 9, 8, and 6 days, respectively. Most samples of zedoary oil-impregnated sand granules stored at each temperature for 1 month showed slightly higher efficacy than those kept for 2 months. The larvicidal efficacy of samples stored at 4 degrees C seemed to be comparable to that of the fresh sample. The efficacy in killing A. aegypti larvae and good biological stability of zedoary oil-impregnated sand granules make this product promising as an alternative to essential oil in the development of new botanical natural larvicide for use in mosquito control programs.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of -elemene in human cervical cancer SiHa cells and to determine its underlying therapeutic molecular mechanisms. Cell viability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected using an MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, the levels of cell migration and cell invasion were investigated using Transwell and wound healing assays. The expression levels of Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (P15), Cyclin D1, cellular tumor antigen p53, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (Bcl-2), apoptosis regulator BAX (Bax), 72 kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), -catenin, transcription factor 7 (TCF7), and Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc) were analyzed via western blotting. The results revealed that -elemene inhibited the proliferation of SiHa cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Administration of -elemene induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest, as demonstrated by the upregulation of P15 expression and the downregulation of Cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, the present study revealed that -elemene induced apoptosis in SiHa cells by enhancing the expression of p53 and Bax, and suppressing the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, treatment with -elemene inhibited cell migration and invasion via downregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels. Western blotting demonstrated that -elemene reduced the expression levels of -catenin and its downstream target molecule TCF7, thus resulting in reduced levels of their target proteins, including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Bax and MMP-2 in cervical cancer cells. The results of the present study suggested that -elemene may inhibit cell proliferation and invasion, in addition to inducing apoptosis, via attenuation of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in cervical cancer cells.

Herbal remedies bear a high potential to treat postpartum uterine diseases in cows. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare an herbal powder and ceftiofur hydrochloride in the treatment of cows affected with retained placenta and for puerperal metritis prevention. The herbal powder was prepared from a combination of Leonurus artemisia (Laur.) S.Y. Hu F, Angelica sinensis (OLIV.) DIELS (radix), Ligusticum chuanxiong HORT (radix), Sparganiumstoloniferum (Graebn.) Buch.-Ham.exJuz (radix), Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) ROSC (radix), Cyperu srotundus Linn. (radix), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis FISCH (radix). A total of 157 cows diagnosed with retained placenta were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups. Cows in the herbal group (n=85) were treated with an oral dose of 0.5 g crude herb/kg bw once daily for 1-3 day(s), and cows in the control group (n=72) were treated with ceftiofur hydrochloride (2.2 mg/kg bw, i.m.) twice daily for 3 consecutive days. Seventy-three cows had total expulsion of the placenta within 72 h following initial herbal treatment, yet no cows in the control group expelled the placenta during the same time period, and 50 out of 73 cows achieved total expulsion of the placenta following only one herbal treatment. The median time of retained placenta shedding (20.0 vs. 101.5 h; P < 0.01) was shorter in the herbal group than in the control group. The logistic regression analysis indicated that the oral administration of the herbal powder tended to have superior clinical efficacy in metritis prevention compared to the systemic administration of ceftiofur hydrochloride in cows affected with retained placenta (8.2% vs. 11.1%, P=0.057, OR 5.771) within 21 days after parturition. Additionally, fewer cows in the herbal group required additional therapeutic antibiotics compared to the controls (8.2% vs. 26.4%, P=0.003). Evidence from this randomized controlled clinical trial suggested that the herbal powder is a clinically effective treatment for retained placenta and the prevention of puerperal metritis and, thus, might have great potential for the medical management of retained placenta in dairy cows.

On the other hand, theCurcuma zedoaria(CZ) has beneficial effects on the nervous system. However, there is little information on the possible effects of the CZ extract on seizures. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effects of CZ extract on cognitive impairment and oxidative stress induced by epilepsy in rats. Methods Rats were randomly divided into different groups. In all rats (except the sham group), kindling was performed by intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) at a dose of 35 mg/kg every 48 h for 14 days. Positive group received 2 mg/kg diazepam + PTZ; treatment groups received 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg CZ extract + PTZ; and one group received 0.5 mg/kg flumazenil and CZ extract + PTZ. Shuttle box and Morris Water Maze tests were used to measure memory and learning. On the last day of treatments PTZ injection was at dose of 60 mg/kg, tonic seizure threshold and mortality rate were recorded in each group. After deep anesthesia, blood was drawn from the rats' hearts and the hippocampus of all rats was removed. Results Statistical analysis of the data showed that the CZ extract significantly increased the tonic seizure threshold and reduced the pentylenetetrazol-induced mortality and the extract dose of 400 mg/kg was selected as the most effective dose compared to the other doses. It was also found that flumazenil (a GABA(A)receptor antagonist) reduced the tonic seizure threshold compared to the effective dose of the extract. The results of shuttle box and Morris water maze behavioral tests showed that memory and learning decreased in the negative control group and the CZ extract treatment improved memory and learning in rats. The CZ extract also increased antioxidant capacity, decreased MDA and NO in the brain and serum of pre-treated groups in compared to the negative control group. Conclusion: It is concluded that the CZ extract has beneficial effects on learning and memory impairment in PTZ-induced epilepsy model, which has been associated with antioxidant effects in the brain or possibly exerts its effects through the GABAergic system.

Once people hear marker /tree/ necessarily we associate them with the signifier 'tree' in the form of images in the mind. The semiosis process is complete. The signified in the mind is approximately equal but there is no requirement that a marker is denoted /arbor/. The relation between signifier and signified was called arbitrary. Papers to be presented with regard to the arbitrairnes of the meaning of the names of Sundanese medicinal plants to prove that the naming of traditional Sundanese medicinal plants is not purely arbitrary (unmotivated). The theory of meaning of Ferdinand de Saussure used in this study. Regarding iconicity is used the theory of Peirce. The study is qualitative. Data were collected from the field, including the district of Cianjur, Sukabumi, Tasik, Pangandaran, Kuningan, Majalengka and lndramayu; all in the province West Java, Indonesia. It will assess whether the process of naming is pure arbitrary or there is a process of iconicity (motivated). Also it will be proved whether the naming process is related to the hidden desire of the people so that the plant has healing properties. The names of the herbs that arbitrair are for example binahong (Bassela rubra linn), cikur (Kaempferia galanga L.), seureuh (betel), and nnanggu (mangosteen). The names of herbs that are not pure arbitrary for example koneng 'turmeric (for yellow), kumis kucing (like a cat's whiskers), jukut bau (bad smells grass; Ageratum conyzoides L.), and jambu batu 'guava' (it is hard). That the herbs have the power to heal is also demonstrated by using the name of ki (short form of aki 'grandfather; also a term for people who have supernatural powers to cure diseases): kiurat (Plantago major L.) that works to relieve aches for breakdown, kikoneng (Arcangelisia flava L.) which among other things can cure jaundice, and koneng bodas (Curcuma zedoaria) similar to turmeric but white in color with no meaning with regard to efficacy.

They could be different in their chemical properties and biological activities. Therefore, we compared antioxidant activity, total phenolic and flavonoid content of different species and varieties of turmeric namely C. longa [variety: Ryudai gold (RD) and Okinawa ukon], C. xanthorrhiza, C. aromatica, C. amada, and C. zedoaria. The antioxidant activity was determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), reducing power and 2-deoxyribose (2-DR) oxidation assay. Our results suggested that RD contained significantly higher concentrations of total phenolic (157.4 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) and flavonoids (1089.5 mg rutin equivalent/g extract). RD also showed significantly higher DPPH radical-scavenging activity (IC50: 26.4 mu g/mL), ORAC (14,090 mu mol Trolox equivalent/g extract), reducing power absorbance (0.33) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC50: 7.4 mu g/mL). Therefore, RD was chosen for the isolation of antioxidant compounds using silica gel column, Toyopearl HW-40F column, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Structural identification of the compounds was conducted using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The purified antioxidant compounds were bisabolone-9-one (1), 4-methyllene-5-hydroxybisabola-2,10-diene-9-one (2), turmeronol B (3), 5-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-hepten-3-one (4), 3-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hepten-1,5-dione (5), cyclobisdemethoxycurcumin (6), bisdemethoxycurcumin (7), demethoxycurcumin (8) and curcumin (9). The IC50 for DPPH radical-scavenging activity were 474, 621, 234, 29, 39, 257, 198, 47 and 18 mu M and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity were 25.1, 24.4, 20.2, 2.1, 5.1, 17.2, 7.2, 3.3 and 1.5 mu M for compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.

Secretory structures are grouped into an internal and external. Zingiberaceae plants are known as traditional medicine plants and as spice plants due to secretory structures in their tissues. The objective of the research were to describe the secretory structure of Zingiberaceae plants and to discover the qualitatively primary metabolite substances in plant's tissues via histochemistry test. The research was conducted by observation descriptive design, quantitative data including the density of secretory cells per mm(2). The quantitative data were analyzed by ANOVA and continued by Duncan at alpha = 5 %. The results showed that the secretory structures in leaves, rhizome, and the root of 14 species of Zingiberaceae plants are found in the mesophyll of leaves and cortex, and also pith in rhizome and roots. The type of secretory structure is internal. Within the root of Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.(bengle),Curcuma domestica Val. (kunyit), Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Roscoe (kunyit putih), Zingiber zerumbet (L.) J.E. Smith (lempuyang), Alpinia purpurata K. Schum (lengkuas merah), and Curcuma aeruginosa Val. (temu ireng) were found amylum grains, while in Kaemferia galanga L. (kencur), Boesen bergiapandurata L. (temu kunci), and Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. (temulawak) there were no amylum grains in the root as well as in the leaves. The roots of bangle had the greatest density of amylum grain, it had 248.1 +/- 9.8 secretory cells of amylum grains per mm2. Lipids roil droplets) were found in the root of beagle, Zingiber officinale Roxb. Var. emprit (jahe emprit), Zingiber officinale Roxb.Var. Gajah (jahe gajah), Zingiber officinale Roxb. Var. Rubrum (jahe merah), keampferia angustifolia L. (knurl pepet), kunyit, kunyit putih, lempuyang, lengkua smerah, Curcuma aeruginosa Val. (temu ireng), and Curcuma mango Val. and van Zijp (temu mangga); the root of lempuyang had the greatest density of oil droplets, it had 10.4 +/- 2.1 secretory cells of oil droplets per mm(2).All of Zingiberaceae's root and leaves did not have secretory cells of protein. Zingiberaceae's rhizomes had amylum grain, protein granules, and oil droplets. jahe merah's rhizomes had the greatest density of amylum grain, it had 198.3 +/- 21.1 cells of amylum grain per mm(2). Jahe emprit's rhizomes had the greatest density of protein granules, it had254.0 +/- 90.0 cells of protein granules per mm(2). Kunyit putih's rhizomes had the greatest density of oil droplets, it had 254.0 +/- 90.0 cells of oil droplets per mm(2).

ROSC (radix), Cyperu srotundus Linn. (radix), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis FISCH (radix) has a high efficacy in facilitating earlier expulsion of the placenta and lowering puerperal metritis risk, and reproductive outcomes might represent the ultimate therapeutic goal of a treatment option for retained placenta in cows. This trial was carried out to further evaluate the effect of the herbal powder on the subsequent fertility of Holstein dairy cows with retained placenta. The animals were treated with herbal powder (n = 85, 0.5 g crude herb/kg bw, p.o.) once daily for 1-3 day(s) or ceftiofur hydrochloride (n = 72, 2.2 mg/kg bw, i.m.) twice daily for 3 consecutive days, and 75 cows with no clinically visible pathological conditions, given without assistance and with no retained placenta diagnosis were included into the control group. Calving-to-first-Al interval (67.2 +/- 16.2 vs. 81.9 +/- 28.7, p < 0.01), services per conception (1.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.7, p < 0.05), and calving-to-conception interval (101.8 +/- 47.0 vs. 129.6 +/- 56.6, p < 0.01) were lower in the herbal group than in ceftiofur group. Percentage of cows pregnant within 180 days postpartum was the higher in cows from the herbal group compared to cows in ceftiofur group (75.0% vs. 90.6%, p < 0.01). Additionally, the cows in the herbal group had a very similar fertility compared to the healthy controls, including calving-to-first-Al interval (67.2 +/- 16.2 vs. 66.3 +/- 16.9, p > 0.05), first AI conception proportion (48.2% vs. 50.6%, p > 0.05), services per conception (1.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.1, p > 0.05), percentage of cows pregnant within 180 days postpartum (90.6% vs. 93.3%, p > 0.05) and calving-to conception interval (101.8 +/- 47.0 vs. 99.0 +/- 44.7, p > 0.05). Herbal powder used in this trial might have a beneficial clinical efficacy, and thus, might represent a potential effective treatment strategy to improve the subsequent fertility of dairy cows with retained placenta.

Traditional Chinese medicine holds that breast cancer is caused by cold congelation, stagnation of qi and blood stasis. It is usually treated with some pungent and warm Chinese herbs, such as Curcuma longa L and Curcuma zedoaria (Christmn) Rosc, which are effective in promoting blood circulation for removing blood stasis, activating qiflowing and relieving pain. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound, is the main pharmacological component extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. Modern pharmacological studies have found that curcumin has many kinds of pharmacological activities of anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastasis and anti-multidrug resistance. Aim of the study: To explore the mechanism of curcumin and Glioma-associated oncogene homolod-1 (Gli1) on invasion and metastasis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells through the Hedgehog (Hh)/Gli signaling pathway. Material and Methods: The effect of curcumin on TNBC cells was detected by colony formation, wound healing and transwell assay. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) were cultured in serum-free medium and its stemness was detected by flow cytometry and subcutaneous xenografted tumor assay. The formation of mammospheres was used to detect the effect of curcumin and GANT61 (Gli inhibitor)on the formation ability of BCSCs. Gli1 overexpressed was conducted in MDA-MB-231 cells by lentivirus vector HBLV-h-Gli1-3xflag-ZsGreen-PURO. RTqPCR and Western blot were detected the mRNA and protein level of genes of Hh pathway, Epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. The nuclear localization and expression of Gli1 was observed by laser confocal microscope scanning. Co-IP was investigated the key genes interacted with Gli1. Results: The abilities of proliferation, invasion, migration and the formation of mammospheres in TNBC cells were inhibited by curcumin. Furthermore, curcumin reduced the invasion and migration abilities in stable Gli1overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cell. Moreover, curcumin down-regulated the expression of genes related Hh pathway, EMT and stemness in MDA-MB-231 mammospheres. Observation of laser confocal microscope showed that Gli1 were expressed mainly in nucleus in MDA-MB-231 adherent cells and completely in nucleus in BCSCs, which was significantly reduced in the nucleus and cytoplasm after curcumin treatment. Besides, our results suggested that vimentin was interacted with Gli1. Conclusions: Curcumin can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC cells, EMT and characteristics of BCSC by Hedgehog/Gli1 pathway.
